# CI Environments and Branch Policy

This document describes our CI/CD environments, required checks, and branch protection policy for main/master.

## Objectives and constraints (Part 6 — 0)
- Complete Part 6 of DEVELOPMENT_TODO_CHECKLIST to a production‑ready bar.
- Support on‑device GPU training workflow and CPU‑only VPS/cloud deployment with incremental upgrades; retrain on device when needed.
- Keep changes backward‑compatible and non‑disruptive to already‑landed features.

## Environments
- dev: default branch previews and nightly synthetic probes; permissive secrets.
- staging: pre‑prod validation; synthetic probes and optional light k6; restricted secrets.
- prod: protected; release tags only; synthetic probes; alerts enabled.

## Branch protection (main/master)
Require the following status checks to pass before merging:
- ci-all (aggregate gate with multiple jobs)
  - Backend — lint, test, migrations verify
  - Console — type-check, unit/a11y
  - Android SDK — unit tests and size gate
  - iOS SDK — build and test
  - CTV/OTT — Android TV unit/assemble/size
  - CTV tvOS — Swift build/test
- security-trivy (Trivy FS scan) — required
- security-scan (Snyk) — optional/non‑blocking unless policy changes
- synthetic-probes — optional/non‑blocking

See .github/required-checks.json for exact job names.

## Secrets
Store environment‑specific secrets using GitHub Environments (dev/staging/prod):
- GITHUB_TOKEN (default)
- SNYK_TOKEN (optional)
- GITHUB_ACTOR / GITHUB_PACKAGES_URL (for Maven publish on tags)
- SYN_BASE_URL / SYN_API_URL / SYN_AUTH_TOKEN (for probes)

## Toolchain pinning
- Node.js: 18.20.4
- Java/JDK: 17 (Temurin)
- Android: SDK API 34 (with Gradle cache)
- iOS/tvOS: macos-13 runner with Xcode from image; SwiftPM
- Unity: 2020.3/2021.3/2022.3/2023.x (see unity-sdk workflow)
