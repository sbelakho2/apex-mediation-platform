# Pricing & Plans

Transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Pay only for what you use.

## Pricing Model

We use a **revenue share model** - you only pay when you earn. No upfront costs, no monthly fees.

### Revenue Share

| Your Monthly Revenue | Our Share | You Keep |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| €0 - €10,000 | 15% | 85% |
| €10,001 - €50,000 | 12% | 88% |
| €50,001 - €100,000 | 10% | 90% |
| €100,000+ | 8% | 92% |

**Example Calculation**:
- Your app generates **€25,000** in ad revenue this month
- First €10,000 → You keep 85% = **€8,500**
- Remaining €15,000 → You keep 88% = **€13,200**
- **Total you receive: €21,700**
- Our share: €3,300 (13.2% effective rate)
