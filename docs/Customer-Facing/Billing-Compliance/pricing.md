## Revenue Share Model

We use **revenue share** - you only pay when you earn. No upfront costs, no monthly minimums.

### Revenue Base Definition

**"Your Monthly Revenue"** = Publisher-recognized, IVT-adjusted revenue after network clawbacks for the period, aggregated at the account level across all apps & platforms (mobile, web, CTV). Negative adjustments carry forward to prevent gaming.

### Marginal Tier Pricing

We use **marginal (banded) pricing** - each revenue slice is charged at its tier rate. This prevents cliff behavior and ensures you never lose money by earning more.

| Revenue Band | Our Share | You Keep |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| €0 - €10,000 | 15% | 85% |
| €10,001 - €50,000 | 12% | 88% |
| €50,001 - €100,000 | 10% | 90% |
| €100,000+ | 8% | 92% |

**Example Calculation at €120,000/month**:
- First €10,000 @ 15% = **€1,500**
- Next €40,000 (€10,001-€50,000) @ 12% = **€4,800**
- Next €50,000 (€50,001-€100,000) @ 10% = **€5,000**
- Remaining €20,000 (€100,000-€120,000) @ 8% = **€1,600**
- **Total ApexMediation fee: €12,900** (10.75% effective rate)
- **You receive: €107,100** (89.25%)

**Why marginal tiers?** You never lose money by earning more. Each euro above a threshold is simply charged at the next tier rate - standard in financial services and fair for publishers.

## CTV/Web Video Premium

**CTV (Connected TV) and web video** drive higher eCPMs but also require additional infrastructure and support.

**Premium:** Add **+2 percentage points** to each tier

| Revenue Band | Standard Rate | CTV/Web Rate |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| €0 - €10,000 | 15% | **17%** |
| €10,001 - €50,000 | 12% | **14%** |
| €50,001 - €100,000 | 10% | **12%** |
| €100,000+ | 8% | **10%** |

**Example at €120,000 CTV revenue:**
- First €10,000 @ 17% = €1,700
- Next €40,000 @ 14% = €5,600
- Next €50,000 @ 12% = €6,000
- Remaining €20,000 @ 10% = €2,000
- **Total fee: €15,300** (12.75% effective)
- **You receive: €104,700** (87.25%)

**Applies to:**
- CTV/OTT platforms (Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.)
- Web video inventory
- Premium video ad formats

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Mobile in-app display ads (standard rates)
- Mobile banner/interstitial ads (standard rates)
