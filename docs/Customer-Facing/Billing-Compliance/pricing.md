> **Pricing notice:** Rates shown here are current and subject to change with 30 days’ advance notice. Your monthly invoice reflects the authoritative amount owed.

> **Launch status:** ApexMediation is operating a Bring-Your-Own (BYO) control plane. You bring network credentials and accounts; we orchestrate auctions, observability, fraud tooling, and transparency. Managed demand will be announced separately.

Transparent platform fees tied directly to the revenue you already earn.

## What You’re Paying For (BYO)

Because you own every network relationship, ApexMediation does **not** resell media or take custody of demand. The platform fee covers:

1. **The mediation/auction brain** – unified waterfall + HB + pacing/floor guardrails and policy automation.
2. **Observability & debugging** – metrics, SLO dashboards, mediation debugger, adapter-level traces.
3. **Fraud & quality tooling** – shadow ML, anomaly alerts, and IVT guardrails tuned for BYO.
4. **Migration & cryptographic transparency** – Migration Studio, signed logs, reproducible auctions, and transparency receipts.
5. **Convenience & consolidation** – one SDK, one console, one integration instead of managing 10+ adapters per app.

The fee is a **platform fee on gross mediated revenue**, not a margin on ad spend that we control.

## BYO Platform Fee Tiers

All tiers are based on **gross mediated revenue per app portfolio per month** (what the networks pay you before our fee). Fees scale smoothly; there are no cliffs.

| Tier | Gross Mediated Revenue (Monthly) | Platform Fee | Key Inclusions |
|------|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Tier 0 — Starter** | $0 – $10,000 | 0% (free) | Full SDKs (Android, iOS, Unity, Web, TV), up to 5 apps, core analytics, basic debugger. Goal: remove friction for small teams. |
| **Tier 1 — Growth** | $10,001 – $100,000 | 2.5% of mediated revenue | Everything in Starter **plus** advanced observability (adapter metrics, SLO dashboards), Migration Studio, email/Slack support with baseline SLA. |
| **Tier 2 — Scale** | $100,001 – $500,000 | 2.0% of mediated revenue | Everything in Growth **plus** priority support, custom dashboards & exports (BigQuery/S3), early access to fraud/ML features while they run in shadow mode. |
| **Tier 3 — Enterprise** | $500,000+ | Custom (typically 1.0–1.5%) + minimum monthly fee | Everything in Scale **plus** contractual SLAs, custom onboarding/migration help, dedicated Slack channel, quarterly reviews, and bespoke compliance requirements. |

### Payment rails & autopay expectations

- **Starter** &mdash; stays free up to $10k per app per month and does **not** require a payment method on file. Keep shipping until you decide to upgrade.
- **Growth & Scale** &mdash; require an autopay-ready rail (Stripe card or wallet globally, ACH in the US, SEPA in the EU/EEA). We store the method in Stripe and auto-charge as soon as the monthly invoice finalizes so mediation never pauses for billing.
- **Enterprise** &mdash; defaults to the same autopay setup, but finance can approve invoice + wire terms if your procurement process mandates it. Even then, we keep a Stripe rail on file for dunning/backstop charges.

Invoices follow NET 30 terms, but the actual collection happens automatically on the due date via the selected autopay rail. Reminder emails post 5 days before the charge and again the moment Stripe attempts the payment.

### Worked Examples

- **Starter example:** A small studio earns $8,000 this month. The platform fee is 0%. You pay $0 and keep the full $8,000.
- **Growth example:** A studio earns $50,000. The fee is 2.5% of $50,000 = **$1,250**. You receive $48,750.
- **Scale example:** A portfolio earns $250,000. The fee is 2.0% of $250,000 = **$5,000**. You receive $245,000.
- **Enterprise example:** A publisher earns $900,000. The negotiated fee is 1.25% + a $5k minimum. Effective fee = max($11,250, $5,000) = **$11,250** plus any contracted minimum adjustments.

Fees are calculated on IVT-adjusted revenue after network clawbacks. Negative adjustments roll forward to prevent gaming.

## Optional Add-Ons (BYO-Compatible)

These services never take custody of your demand; they layer on top of BYO:

- **White-label console** – Flat monthly fee **or** +0.25% platform fee uplift per tenant.
- **Extended data retention / premium analytics** – Per-month surcharge for additional lookback windows and advanced modeling.
- **Hands-on migration services** – One-time consulting fee per studio for adapter mapping, QA, and on-site support.

---

## Why This Model Fits BYO

- **No network credentials change hands.** SDK adapters use your accounts, so compliance and rev rec stay simple.
- **Aligned incentives.** Our revenue is tied to how much value we mediate for you, not which networks you use.
- **Simple message.** “We take 0–2.5% of the revenue you already earn, in exchange for better fill, fewer crashes, and full transparency.”
- **Predictable scaling.** As your mediated revenue grows, the effective fee rate drops and unlocks more tooling/support.

## Payment Terms

### Invoice Schedule (NET 30)

We meter your gross mediated revenue every calendar month and invoice you for the applicable platform fee on the 1st of the following month.

- **Month closes** (e.g., Oct 1–31 usage captured)
- **Invoice issued** on **Nov 1** with detailed revenue bands
- **Payment due NET 30** → **Nov 30** in this example
- **Reminder cadence:** 7 days before due date + day-of notification

Balances below **€100** automatically roll forward until the cumulative fee meets the minimum invoice amount. Nothing expires—you’ll see the carryover line item on the next statement.

### How to Pay

1. **Autopay (default once you leave Starter)**
	- Growth/Scale customers add a Stripe payment method (card, Apple/Google Pay wallet, ACH in the US, SEPA direct debit in the EU). We auto-charge on the NET 30 due date using Stripe&rsquo;s retry schedule (day 0/3/5/7) so mediation keeps running without manual steps.
	- Enterprise keeps the same default autopay rail. If your finance team needs invoice + wire terms, request approval via billing@apexmediation.ee and we&rsquo;ll flag the account while still retaining the autopay method as a fallback.
2. **Manual wires (approved exceptions only)**
	- **SEPA (EUR default)** – Wise Europe SA IBAN (fee-free, same/next-day)
	- **ACH (USD default)** – Wise US / Community Federal Savings Bank account (1–3 US banking days)
3. **Other secondary rails**
	- **Stripe hosted payment link** – great for ad-hoc card payments or wallet top-ups.
	- **PayPal** – 2% pass-through fee; gross up to cover their network fee.
	- **Wise multi-currency link** – ideal for CAD/GBP/SGD wires at mid-market FX.

Invoices are denominated in **EUR**. We display your mediated revenue in your local currency for convenience, but the payable amount is converted using the **ECB daily rate** on the invoice date. Autopay charges occur in EUR; Stripe handles the FX automatically if your card settles in another currency.

## Comparison Snapshot

| Feature | ApexMediation (BYO) | Legacy Network A | Legacy Network B |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Platform fee | 0–2.5% (banded) | ~30% opaque take | 25–35% cliff |
| SDKs required | 1 (ours) + your BYO adapters | 5–10 | 5–10 |
| Transparency | Signed logs, Migration Studio, debugger | Limited | Limited |

## FAQs

### When do I start paying?

- Starter tier is free forever.
- Growth, Scale, and Enterprise platform fees apply only once your mediated revenue crosses their thresholds. Charges show up on your monthly invoice (NET 30) alongside usage details.

### Are there any hidden fees?

**No.** The only costs are:
- The platform fee percentage for your tier (0–2.5% or your negotiated enterprise rate)
- Optional add-ons you explicitly enable
- Payment method fees (only if using PayPal)

### Can I test before committing?

**Yes!** Sign up free, integrate the SDK, and test with live traffic. If you're not happy, remove the SDK - no contracts, no cancellation fees.

### What if I have both mobile and CTV traffic?

All channels count toward the same tier. We break out CTV/web video vs. mobile revenue in the dashboard, but the platform fee is applied to the total mediated revenue for the month unless you enable a specific add-on.

### Do you offer discounts for non-profits?

Yes! Non-profit organizations and educational institutions qualify for **50% off** the platform fee.

**Contact**: support@bel-consulting.ee with proof of non-profit status.
