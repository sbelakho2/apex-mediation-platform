## Getting Started

### How long does integration take?

**Answer**: Most developers complete integration in **under 10 minutes**. Our SDKs are designed to be plug-and-play with minimal configuration.

**Typical timeline**:
- Install SDK: 2 minutes
- Initialize: 1 minute
- Add first ad placement: 3 minutes
- Test: 4 minutes

**See**: [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

---

### Do I need a credit card to sign up?

**Answer**: **No**. Sign up is completely free with no credit card required. You only start paying a platform fee once your mediated revenue moves beyond the Starter tier (>$10k/month).

---

### Which platforms do you support?

**Answer**: We support all major platforms:
- ✅ **Unity** (iOS, Android, desktop)
- ✅ **iOS** (Swift, Objective-C)
- ✅ **Android** (Kotlin, Java)
- ✅ **Web** (JavaScript)
- ✅ **React Native** (official bridge — contact support to enable)
- ✅ **Flutter** (official bridge — contact support to enable)

For other engines (Unreal, Godot, custom C++), reach out to support so we can share the latest integration options.

### Can I use ApexMediation with other ad networks?

**Answer**: **Yes**. Our platform is a **mediation layer** that works alongside other ad networks. We integrate with:
- AdMob
- Unity Ads
- ironSource
- AppLovin
- Vungle
- And 20+ more

You can use us exclusively or as part of your existing stack.

---

### What is your platform fee?

**Answer**: Our BYO tiers charge a percentage of **gross mediated revenue** each month:
- **Starter**: $0 – $10k → **0%** (free)
- **Growth**: $10,001 – $100k → **2.5%**
- **Scale**: $100,001 – $500k → **2.0%**
- **Enterprise**: $500k+ → **1.0–1.5%** with a custom minimum

Because you bring your own demand, these fees simply cover the control plane, observability, and Migration Studio – not a resale margin.

---

### How do I pay my invoice?

**Answer**: We invoice you for the monthly platform fee (NET 30). Send payment using the rails listed on the invoice:
1. **SEPA (EUR)** – Wise Europe SA IBAN, free, same/next-day
2. **ACH (USD)** – Wise US account (Community Federal Savings Bank), 1–3 US business days

Need alternatives?
3. **Stripe card/wallet** – 2.9% + fee, instant confirmation
4. **PayPal** – +2% fee, <48h settlement
5. **Wise multi-currency link** – for CAD/GBP/SGD or rapid FX conversions

Open **Dashboard → Billing → Invoices** to download the PDF/CSV and copy the wiring block. Each invoice email repeats the SEPA + ACH reference to avoid transcription errors.

---

### What happens if our fee is below the minimum invoicing threshold?

**Answer**: We only issue an invoice once your accumulated platform fee reaches **€100**. If a month closes below that amount, the balance rolls forward and appears on the next invoice. Nothing expires—you’ll just see the carryover line item when it crosses the threshold.

**Example**: You owe €75 in January (below €100) → €75 carries over → February fee is €50 → March 1 invoice shows €125 due NET 30.

---

### Are there any hidden fees?

**Answer**: **No**. The only costs are:
- The platform fee for your tier (0–2.5% or negotiated enterprise rate)
- Optional add-ons (white-label console, extended retention, etc.)
- Payment method fees (PayPal: 2%, Crypto: 1%)

No setup fees, no monthly minimums, no surprise surcharges.

## Technical Questions

### What is eCPM and how is it calculated?

**Answer**: **eCPM** (effective Cost Per Mille) is the estimated earnings per 1,000 ad impressions.

**Formula**: `eCPM = (Total Revenue / Total Impressions) × 1000`

**Example**: You earned €50 from 25,000 impressions:
```
eCPM = (€50 / 25,000) × 1000 = €2.00
```

**Typical eCPM ranges**:
- Interstitial ads: €5-€15
- Rewarded video ads: €10-€25
- Banner ads: €0.50-€2

---

### How do I increase my eCPM?

**Answer**: Several strategies:

1. **Enable Geographic Discount Optimizer** - Adjusts CPM by country (typically +15-25% revenue)
2. **Use rewarded video ads** - Highest eCPM but requires game mechanic integration
3. **A/B test ad placements** - Find optimal times and locations
4. **Enable Self-Evolving AI** - Automated optimization (typically +20-40% revenue)
5. **Target high-value countries** - US, UK, Canada, Nordic countries have higher CPMs
6. **Improve ad relevance** - More accurate user segments = better match = higher bids

**See**: [Performance Optimization Guide](/docs/advanced/performance-optimization)

---

### Why am I not seeing any ads?

**Common Causes**:

1. **Test Mode Enabled** - Go to Dashboard → App Settings → Disable Test Mode
2. **Invalid API Key** - Check your API key in Dashboard → API Keys
3. **Ad Unit Not Created** - Create ad units in Dashboard → Ad Units
4. **Country Not Supported** - Check [supported countries list](/docs/features/supported-countries)
5. **Ad Blockers** - Ask testers to disable ad blockers
6. **Integration Error** - Check console for error messages

**Still stuck?** [Contact support](mailto:support@bel-consulting.ee) with your app ID.

---

### Can I use ApexMediation in a game for children?

**Answer**: **Yes**, but you must comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR requirements:

1. **Enable Child-Directed Mode** in Dashboard → App Settings
2. **No personalized ads** - Only contextual ads will be shown
3. **Obtain parental consent** before collecting any data
4. **No third-party analytics** - Disable Google Analytics, etc.

**Note**: Child-directed apps typically have 30-50% lower eCPM due to advertising restrictions.

**See**: [COPPA Compliance Guide](/docs/billing-compliance/coppa)

---

### How does fraud detection work?

**Answer**: We use multi-layered fraud detection:

1. **Real-time Analysis** - Each ad impression analyzed in < 50ms
2. **IP Reputation** - Block known bot IPs and data centers
3. **Device Fingerprinting** - Detect emulators and modified devices
4. **Behavioral Patterns** - Flag unusual click/impression ratios
5. **VPN/Proxy Detection** - Identify location spoofing
6. **ML Models** - Continuously learning from fraud patterns

**Fraud Rate**: < 0.5% across our network (industry average: 3-5%)

**Transparency**: See blocked impressions in Dashboard → Analytics → Fraud Report
