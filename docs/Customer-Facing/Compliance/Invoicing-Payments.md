## Payment Schedule

### Monthly Payouts with NET 30 Terms

**ApexMediation uses industry-standard NET 30 payment terms** - payment due 30 days after invoice.

**Payment Schedule:**
```
Calendar month:          Revenue earned (e.g., Oct 1-31)
1st of following month:  Invoice issued (e.g., Nov 1)
NET 30 from invoice:     Payment due date (e.g., Nov 30)
Due date:                Payment processed
+2-5 business days:      Payment received
```

**Example:**
```
Oct 1-31:       Earn $12,345.67
Nov 1:          Invoice issued
Nov 30:         Payment due (NET 30)
Dec 2-5:        Payment received in your account
```

### Minimum Payout Threshold

**€100 minimum threshold** - standard to cover payment processing costs. Earnings below threshold automatically roll over to the next month and never expire.

### Holiday Schedule

**Payments delayed by bank holidays:**
- Christmas: Dec 25-26
- New Year: Jan 1
- Easter: Variable (Good Friday, Easter Monday)
- Other: National holidays in your country

**Delayed payment:** Next business day

---

## Revenue Sharing

### Revenue Base Definition

**"Your Monthly Revenue"** = Publisher-recognized, IVT-adjusted revenue after network clawbacks for the period, aggregated at the account level across all apps & platforms (mobile, web, CTV).

**Key points:**
- Invalid traffic (IVT/fraud) is filtered out
- Network clawbacks/adjustments applied
- Negative adjustments carry forward (prevents gaming)
- Aggregated across all your apps and platforms
- Calculated monthly for billing period

### Marginal Tier Pricing

**We use marginal (banded) tiers** - each revenue slice is charged at its tier rate. You never lose money by earning more.

| Revenue Band | Our Share | You Keep |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| €0 - €10,000 | 15% | 85% |
| €10,001 - €50,000 | 12% | 88% |
| €50,001 - €100,000 | 10% | 90% |
| €100,000+ | 8% | 92% |

**Example at €1,000 revenue:**
```

### CTV/Web Video Premium

**CTV/OTT and web video** adds **+2 percentage points** to each tier rate.

| Revenue Band | Standard | CTV/Web |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| €0 - €10,000 | 15% | 17% |

**Example at €120,000 CTV revenue:**
```
Revenue:                      €120,000.00

   - Invoice number
   - Expected amount
   - Actual amount
   - Explanation

### Response Time

**Initial response:** Within 24 hours
**Resolution:** Within 5 business days

### Common Reasons for Discrepancies

1. **Invalid Traffic Filtering**
   - We filter fraud/invalid clicks
   - Refunds from ad networks
   - Typically 1-3% of traffic
  - Deducted before platform fee calculation

2. **Currency Exchange**
   - Some networks pay in different currencies
   - Exchange rate fluctuations
   - Check "Revenue Breakdown" in invoice

3. **Revenue Timing**
   - Some networks report delayed
   - Previous week's adjustments
   - Check "Prior Period Adjustments"

4. **Chargebacks & Network Clawbacks**
   - Advertiser disputes charge
   - Network adjustments for invalid traffic
   - Rare (<0.5%)
   - Detailed in invoice notes
   - Negative adjustments carry forward

5. **Channel Mix Classification**
  - Dashboard shows mobile vs. CTV/web video revenue
  - Platform fee applies to total mediated revenue (no separate surcharge)
  - Add-ons, if enabled, are itemized separately

### Adjustments

**If discrepancy confirmed:**

**Credit adjustment:**
```
Invoice #INV-2025-11-02

Net Payment:                $1,234.56
Prior Period Adjustment:    +$265.44
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:                      $1,500.00
