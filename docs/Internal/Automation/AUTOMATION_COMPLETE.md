## 🤖 Zero-Touch Operation

### Human Oversight Required

**Time Investment:** <5 minutes/week

**Monday Morning (3 minutes):**
1. Review `system_health_dashboard` (health score should be >90)
2. Check `optimization_queue` WHERE confidence <0.8 (approve/reject risky AI changes)
3. Review `incidents` WHERE status = 'unresolved' (escalate if needed)

**Friday Afternoon (2 minutes):**
1. Review `churn_interventions` success rate (target >50%)
2. Check `referral_rewards` credited this week
3. Review `evolution_log` failures (learn patterns)
