OBSOLETE — historical backlog reference. Keep for context, but see the quick notes below for active developer commands.

## Active developer quick notes (Backend tests & VRA)

- Run all backend tests (controllers/services, redaction, CLIs, matching/reconcile) from repo root:

  ```bash
  npm run test:backend
  ```

- What this does:
  - Invokes `backend/jest.config.js` (self‑contained discovery for `backend/src/**` and `backend/scripts/**`, both `.ts` and `.js`).
  - Executes suites including VRA: controllers validation, CSV redaction, logger redaction, matching determinism/large‑N, reconcile boundaries, and CLI guardrails.

- Useful env toggles for local runs:
  - `VRA_LARGEN=1` — enables larger synthetic dataset in `matchingEngine.largeN.test.ts` (keep off by default for speed).
  - `LOG_LEVEL=warn` — reduces console noise during Jest runs.

- Manual API smoke (when backend is running):
  - Inverted windows must return 400 across endpoints:
    - `GET /api/v1/recon/overview?from=<later>&to=<earlier>` → 400
    - `GET /api/v1/recon/deltas?...` and `/api/v1/recon/deltas.csv?...` → 400
  - CSV export should have 8 columns, `amount` to 6 d.p., `confidence` to 2 d.p., and sanitized `reason_code` (no commas/newlines/tabs).

- Operator CLIs (dry‑run first):
  - `node backend/scripts/vraBuildExpected.js --from <iso> --to <iso> --limit 10000 --dry-run`
  - `node backend/scripts/vraReconcile.js --from <iso> --to <iso> --dry-run`
  - Guardrails: >3‑day windows and `--limit` > 10k are blocked unless `--force --yes` is provided.

# FIXES Backlog




_Last updated: 2025-11-14 22:16 UTC_

## Purpose
- Translate `AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md` risks into an actionable, testable backlog.
- Preserve a single prioritized sequence so teams can swarm without blocking each other.
- Provide traceability by linking every TODO entry in the appendix back to the fix that will resolve it.

## Prioritization Method
1. Grouped every `**Risks/TODOs**` entry by top-level directory (backend, console, website, SDKs, ML, infra, docs, etc.) and mapped each group to a fix ID.
2. Scored each entry for severity (security/auth keywords, reliability hints, mock/placeholder indicators).
3. Sorted items by fix priority (security + platform first) and severity to yield the ordered appendix below.
4. Counted coverage per fix so teams can forecast scope and ensure every TODO has an owner.

## Ordered Fix Backlog

### FIX-01 — Backend & Core Platform Hardening (28 TODOs)

**Goal:** Restore deployable backend artifacts and close the most dangerous auth / platform gaps exposed in `docker-compose.yml`, `backend/Dockerfile`, auth controllers, API key services, and rate-limit middleware before other teams depend on them.

**Key actions:**
- Rebuild `backend/Dockerfile` as a clean multi-stage Node 20 image, align `fly.toml`+`deploy-backend.sh` ports, and add runtime health probes so Fly deployments stop failing.
- Replace placeholder secrets across root `.env` files and `docker-compose.yml`, add ClickHouse volume mounts, and wire the website container into the compose network so local testing mirrors prod.
- Split monolithic controllers (`auth`, `migration`, `reporting`, `transparency`) into focused modules with request-size caps, per-endpoint rate limiters, and structured logging so a single bad request cannot crash the API.
- Persist the currently in-memory security services (`twofa.service`, `apiKeys.controller`, `twofa.controller`) into Postgres/Redis and ensure middleware differentiates auth failures vs system faults when redirecting to `/signin`.
- Add schema validation + auth to data export, analytics ingestion, SKAdNetwork, and admin endpoints, and document the error contract for console + SDK clients.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npm run lint --workspace backend` (ESLint + typecheck)
- `npm run test --workspace backend` plus targeted Jest suites for auth, billing, analytics, and transparency controllers
- `npm run test:integration --workspace backend` covering dockerized Postgres/ClickHouse flows
- `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile .` and `fly deploy --dry-run` per environment

**Cross-fix alignment:** Coordinate with FIX-03 (console) and FIX-05 (SDK) so the revised auth/session semantics propagate through NextAuth clients and SDK token helpers without regressions.

### FIX-02 — Fraud & Inference Services Production Readiness (8 TODOs)

**Goal:** Productionize the Python/FastAPI inference services (`services/fraud-inference`, `services/inference-ml`) plus transparency writers so model artifacts load reliably, health checks pass, and unauthenticated scoring endpoints cannot be abused.

**Key actions:**
- Ship missing Python deps (`requests` for Docker healthchecks), enforce model file existence on startup, and add readiness probes so Kubernetes/Fly only routes traffic after ONNXRuntime finishes loading.
- Add auth + tenant scoping to `/v1/score` and `/predict/*` routes, honoring JWTs issued by the backend to stop anonymous scoring.
- Parameterize model artifact volumes/PVCs referenced in Helm charts and document rotation workflows for `models/fraud/latest` so deployments stay in sync.
- Tighten transparency writer + sampling jobs by surfacing breaker metrics, redacting sensitive payloads, and alerting when ClickHouse inserts fail.
- Document a canary/test harness for `services/fraud-inference` and `services/inference-ml` inside `services/README` so ops can rehearse rollbacks.

**Validation & tests:**
- `pip install -r services/fraud-inference/requirements.txt && pytest`
- `pip install -r services/inference-ml/requirements.txt && pytest`
- Container smoke: `docker build services/fraud-inference` + `docker run -p 8080:8080 … curl /health`
- End-to-end scoring check invoked from backend integration tests once auth headers are enforced

**Cross-fix alignment:** Relies on FIX-06 for validated model manifests and on FIX-08 for ServiceMonitor wiring so RED metrics surface in Grafana.

### FIX-03 — Console Productization & Data Integrity (111 TODOs)

**Goal:** Replace console mock data (`console/src/app/dashboard/*`, migration studio, transparency) with real API wiring, enforce RBAC per navigation entry, and complete billing/fraud/payout workflows so operators view truthful data.

**Key actions:**
- Remove demo-only flows in `console/src/app/login/page.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`, and `useSession` so auth always goes through backend NextAuth with CSRF + refresh token handling.
- Bind dashboard tiles (`dashboard/page.tsx`, `analytics/page.tsx`, Fraud/Payout widgets) to live `/api/v1/*` endpoints via TanStack Query with proper loading/error states and currency localization.
- Finish billing + payout UX: dedupe duplicate settings routes, add confirmation dialogs, localize invoices, and respect plan entitlements before enabling admin shortcuts.
- Tighten admin/migration/transparency tools by paging large datasets, sanitizing rendered JSON, and gating guardrail actions behind feature flags tied to backend capabilities.
- Consolidate query-param hooks (`useQueryParams` variants) and add AbortController plumbing so rapid filter changes don’t race stale network responses.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npm run lint --workspace console`
- `npm run test --workspace console` (Jest + RTL suites for Navigation, transparency pages, billing clients)
- `npx playwright test --config console/playwright.config.ts` for dashboard/billing flows
- `npx lhci autorun --config console/lighthouse.config.cjs` for billing + transparency routes

**Cross-fix alignment:** Depends on FIX-01 backend contracts and FIX-04 website auth redirects so the shared session cookie works consistently.

### FIX-04 — Website Productization & Compliance (68 TODOs)

**Goal:** Turn the marketing website from static mock dashboards into a production-safe experience: replace placeholder dashboard data, clean up security posture, and align copy with actual product capabilities before launch.

**Key actions:**
- Wire `/dashboard/*` pages (`revenue`, `analytics`, `fraud`, `apps`, `placements`, `observability`) to backend APIs and say what data API/keys are necessary when necessary; remove misleading `$0` metrics and fake timelines.
- Fix `'use client'` + `metadata` conflicts on `about/contact`, ensure cookie banner + consent states persist and integrate with backend CMP APIs.
- Audit env handling: split public vs server secrets, update `next.config.js` CSP to allow analytics, and document required env vars in `.env.example` and `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Update homepage copy, quiz results, and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` claims to reflect real SLA/accuracy numbers to avoid legal risk.
- Ensure website scripts (`deploy.sh`, `monitor.sh`) run from repo root, add Linux-compatible date logic, and feed results into quality gates.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npm run lint --workspace website`
- `npm run test --workspace website` (security header Jest suite + any new component tests)
- `npx playwright test quality/e2e/website/visual.spec.ts` for regression screenshots
- `npx lhci autorun --config quality/lighthouse/website.config.cjs`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Shares auth + session cookie with console (FIX-03) and depends on backend auth (FIX-01); coordinate rollout of new cookie names and middleware protections.

### FIX-05 — SDK & Client Reliability (61 TODOs)

**Goal:** Bring every SDK (web, Android/iOS, Unity, CTV) to production readiness by persisting consent + 2FA data, finishing adapter implementations, and documenting release/telemetry pipelines.

**Key actions:**
- Web SDK: document AbortController overrides, add retries/backoff in `auctionClient`, and ensure MSW test setup imports `tests/msw/server` so Jest suites actually run.
- Android/iOS SDKs: persist remote config + consent across restarts, remove placeholder adapters (BelInterstitial/Rewarded), and flesh out auction fallback + OM SDK instrumentation before publishing.
- Unity package: update IL2CPP docs to reflect shipped TCF parser, expand inspector/editor tooling to cover performance budget + platform bridges, and finish Samples validation.
- CTV SDKs: finish renderers + telemetry, handle remote config download failures, and align consent semantics with mobile SDKs.
- Establish release automation: verify Gradle/CocoaPods/npm packages share adapter parity, add checksum/signature verification, and document verification scripts in `Packages/.../RELEASING.md`.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npm run test --workspace packages/web-sdk` with MSW servers wired
- Android: `./gradlew test` plus instrumentation smoke in sample app
- iOS: `xcodebuild test -scheme ApexMediationSDK` or Swift Package tests
- Unity: `unity -runTests` leveraging `Packages/com.rivalapexmediation.sdk/Tests`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Relies on backend auth/token (FIX-01) and console feature flags (FIX-03) to expose/verify new SDK capabilities.

### FIX-06 — Data & ML Pipeline Hardening (97 TODOs)

**Goal:** Stabilize data + ML tooling—clean up enrichment manifests, enforce dataset schemas, and ensure training/inference pipelines can scale without loading entire datasets into memory.

**Key actions:**
- Add checksums + versioning to `data/enrichment` and `data/weak-supervision` manifests, automate refresh scripts, and validate JSON/CSV inputs before loading to prevent crashes.
- Refactor ML scripts (`train_models`, `feature_engineering`, `weak_supervision`) to stream data or chunk via Dask, adding schema validation so categorical fields aren’t silently cast to float zero.
- Ensure duplication between `models/fraud/logreg_dev_2` manifests and `workdir` copies is removed—pick one source of truth and enforce via CI.
- Document GPU vs CPU dependency matrices (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) and align versions so torch/tabpfn builds stop diverging.
- Extend `ML/scripts/tests` to cover corrupt manifest cases, large dataset pagination, and concurrency while wiring nightly pipelines into CI.

**Validation & tests:**
- `poetry run pytest` (or `pip install -r ML/requirements.txt && pytest ML/scripts/tests`)
- `make ml.prepare ml.train` using sampled datasets
- `python ML/scripts/validate_export.py --model-path …` on promoted artifacts
- Drift monitoring smoke via `python ML/scripts/monitor_shadow_scores.py --dry-run`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Outputs feed FIX-02 services and FIX-05 SDKs; coordinate manifest/schema changes so scoring services and SDK calculators stay compatible.

#### FIX-06 — Completion log and Phase checklist (6–10)

- [x] 6) CI workflows — PR fast lane + Nightly
  - Files: `.github/workflows/ml-pr.yml`, `.github/workflows/ml-nightly.yml`
  - Notes: Both lanes now install with constraints (`-c ML/constraints.txt`). PR lane runs tests + SoT guard + schema smoke; Nightly validates manifests, runs streaming FE and row‑limited train, and uploads artifacts.
- [x] 7) Manifest SoT enforcement
  - Files: `ML/scripts/check_manifests.py` (wired in PR workflow), `ML/scripts/manifest_tools.py` (scan/validate/refresh/compute‑checksum)
  - Notes: Prevents stray `*manifest*.json` outside approved paths; unit tests cover checksums and strict modes.
- [x] 8) Dependency matrices & environment parity
  - Files: `Dockerfile.ml`, `Dockerfile.ml-gpu` (now install with `-c ML/constraints.txt`), `ML/constraints.txt` (pins aligned with `requirements*.txt`)
  - Notes: CI updated to consume constraints; GPU guidance left via comments in `requirements-gpu.txt` for selecting the proper CUDA wheel when needed.
- [x] 9) Documentation & CHANGELOG
  - Files: `ML/README.md` (quick‑start), `CHANGELOG.md` (new FIX‑06 entry)
  - Notes: README documents local install, tests, manifest validation, streaming FE + tiny train, and CI lanes.
- [x] 10) Validation & sign‑off
  - Files: `docs/Internal/Development/FIX-06_SIGNOFF.md`
  - Notes: Checklist for making the ML PR workflow a required check, weekly nightly artifact review, and local verification commands. Final sign‑off to be recorded in that doc and in GitHub branch protection settings (admin action).

### FIX-07 — Quality & Testing Automation (14 TODOs)

**Goal:** Elevate the shared quality toolchain: finish outstanding Playwright/Lighthouse coverage, keep k6 load tests runnable, and enforce linting for custom scripts.

**Key actions:**
- Parameterize Playwright tests (billing, website, transparency) to respect env creds and make them part of CI required checks.
- Update Lighthouse configs to run multiple samples per route and capture artifacts for triage.
- Wire k6 load/perf tests (`quality/load-tests`, `quality/perf/billing`) into optional pipelines, injecting real JWTs and ensuring counters fail the build on regressions.
- Improve custom linters (`quality/lint/no-hardcoded-hex.js`) to cover SCSS/JSON theme files and document how to run them locally.
- Create a single README describing how quality suites map to product areas + failure owners.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npx playwright test` for e2e suites
- `npx lhci autorun` for lighthouse configs
- `k6 run quality/load-tests/auction-load-test.js` (with env vars)
- `node quality/lint/no-hardcoded-hex.js website/src console/src`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Depends on fixes in 03/04 to provide deterministic data; use feature flags or seeded fixtures during tests to avoid flaky marketing numbers.

### FIX-08 — Infrastructure & Observability Maturity (44 TODOs)

**Goal:** Harden infrastructure + monitoring: align Helm charts with actual secrets, finish ServiceMonitor wiring, and ensure docker-compose monitoring stack reflects production endpoints.

**Key actions:**
- Update `infrastructure/helm/*` values to avoid `tag: latest`, document prerequisites for enabling NetworkPolicy/ServiceMonitor, and add missing ConfigMaps for Next.js envs.
- Ensure Prometheus/Loki/Grafana configs reference reachable hosts in local vs prod setups (replace Fly.io hostnames for local compose).
- Secure Alertmanager/Promtail secrets via env files, not inline placeholders, and verify Slack/Twilio routes are tested via `deploy-monitoring.sh`.
- Sync Terraform modules (AI cost controls, etc.) with docs, parameterizing CIDR allowlists + Slack webhooks and adding retries to CronJobs.
- Document log retention + rotation so repo-stored logs (`logs/combined.log`, `logs/error.log`) are scrubbed or moved to artifacts.

**Validation & tests:**
- `helm template infrastructure/helm/backend` & `helm lint`
- `terraform validate infrastructure/terraform`
- `docker compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.yml up` healthcheck
- Alert routing smoke via `./monitoring/deploy-monitoring.sh test-alerts`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Observability dashboards read ClickHouse metrics fixed in FIX-06 and backend labels from FIX-01; coordinate label changes before redeploying ServiceMonitors.

### FIX-09 — Automation & Tooling Readiness (15 TODOs)

**Goal:** Make automation scripts (`scripts/*.sh`) safe for repeated use: remove embedded secrets, add argument validation, and ensure commands run from repo root with consistent tooling.

**Key actions:**
- Parameterize secrets embedded in `dev-transparency-metrics.sh`, `setup-s3-accounting.sh`, and others so operators pass env vars or Infisical references instead of editing scripts.
- Normalize working directories in `website/scripts/deploy.sh`, `capture-*.sh`, and `verify-console-connection.sh` to avoid installing dependencies in nested folders.
- Add `shellcheck` + `set -euo pipefail` where missing to stop silent failures.
- Document prerequisites (AWS CLI, Fly CLI, Playwright browsers) directly inside `scripts/README.md` along with troubleshooting steps.
- Provide dry-run flags or confirmation prompts for destructive actions (S3 compliance mode, CI deployments).

**Validation & tests:**
- `shellcheck scripts/*.sh website/scripts/*.sh`
- Script-specific dry runs (e.g., `./scripts/validate-deployment.sh --dry-run`)
- Integration rehearsal of capture/deploy scripts inside CI to verify absence of hard-coded paths

**Cross-fix alignment:** Script outputs power FIX-04 monitoring and FIX-08 observability; align log locations + env var names to avoid drift.



### FIX-10 — Documentation Governance & Accuracy (163 TODOs)

**Goal:** Curate documentation: deduplicate overlapping deployment/completion notes, align status files with real progress, and keep indexes accurate.

**Key actions:**
- Merge duplicate "complete" docs in `docs/Internal/Deployment` (PROJECT_COMPLETE vs PROJECT_COMPLETION vs SYSTEM_COMPLETE) and explain scope differences.
- Update `docs/INDEX.md`, `ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`, and `Website` docs whenever new sections/folders are added so the nav stays truthful.
- Ensure roadmap/checklist docs reference the new FIXES backlog instead of stale TODO files, and add change logs to long-form guides (SRS, automation playbooks).
- Clarify legal/compliance docs (PCI, GDPR, transparency) with current ownership + review dates.
- Add pointers from customer-facing docs to live product screenshots once FIX-03/04 deliver data-backed UIs.

**Validation & tests:**
- `npx markdownlint-cli2 "docs/**/*.md"` (or Vale) for formatting
- Link checker across `/docs` tree (e.g., `npx markdown-link-check`)
- Manual review cadences logged in `docs/Internal/Development/AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Cross-fix alignment:** Every fix should push updates back into docs; embed this expectation into PR templates and ensure FIX-01–FIX-09 link to authoritative runbooks here.

#### FIX-10 — Completion log & cadence (1–7)
- [x] 1) Canonical deployment status doc (`docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md`) created; `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md`, `PROJECT_COMPLETION.md`, and `SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` archived with redirect notes (2025-11-18).
- [x] 2) `docs/INDEX.md` banner added to call out the canonical status doc and mark legacy files as historical (2025-11-18).
- [x] 3) `docs/Internal/Development/DEVELOPMENT_TODO_CHECKLIST.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` now reference `FIXES.md` + `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, include governance reminders, and carry change logs (2025-11-18).
- [x] 4) Updated `docs/ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` and `docs/ORIGINAL_README.md` with FIX-10 governance banners, canonical source links, delivery snapshot, and change logs; remaining customer-facing nav docs still tracked separately (2025-11-18).
- [x] 5) Added FIX-10 governance banners + change logs to `docs/Architecture/enhanced_ad_stack_srs_v2_0.md`, `docs/Internal/Automation/ZERO_TOUCH_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/Internal/Security/COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`; each now references `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `FIXES.md`, and `AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md` (2025-11-18).
- [x] 6) Updated `docs/Customer-Facing/README.md` and `website/README.md` with FIX-10 governance banners, accurate status language, refreshed structures, and change logs (2025-11-18).
- [x] 7) Added ownership, review cycles, and governance banners to legal/compliance docs: `GDPR-Compliance.md`, `Invoicing-Payments.md`, `PCI_SCOPE.md`, `COST_BUDGET_POLICY.md`, `ESTONIAN_E_SYSTEMS.md`, `pricing.md`, `WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `VERIFY.md`, `REQUIRED_CHECKS.md`; all READMEs in backend/console/ML/SDK/web-sdk updated with FIX references; CHANGELOG entry added; PROJECT_STATUS.md updated with completed FIX-07/08/09 (2025-11-18).

### FIX-11 — Cross-cutting Misc Backlog (94 TODOs)

**Goal:** Catch-all items spanning logs, customer artifacts, and miscellaneous directories; triage them into future focused fixes once capacity frees up.

**Key actions:**
- Audit checked-in logs and binaries for sensitive data; rotate or remove historical files while keeping reproducible fixtures elsewhere.
- Review miscellaneous packages (`sdk/ctv`, `Packages/...`, `misc docx`) and decide whether to archive, move to dedicated repos, or bring them under the active fix streams.
- Stand up a backlog triage ritual so new TODOs from the analysis log immediately map to existing FIX IDs instead of piling into "misc".
- Automate regeneration of helper inventories (e.g., `scripts/validate-billing-tests.sh`) so they stay accurate as code moves.
- Close the loop by updating `AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md` progress checkboxes and referencing FIX-IDs beside each risk entry.

**Validation & tests:**
- Spot checks using `git ls-files | grep -E '(log|.docx)'` to keep repo clean
- Custom scripts verifying no orphaned references remain after moving assets
- Periodic review of this FIX backlog to ensure items graduate into the themed fixes

**Cross-fix alignment:** Feeds future work into FIX-01–FIX-10; do not start misc work without confirming it truly falls outside other structured tracks.

   - Add CLI command references.
- **599 / FIX-10** `docs/Transparency/2025-11-10-transparency-console-ux-polish.md`
   - Document assumes tasks done; ensure design backlog updated.
- **600 / FIX-10** `docs/Transparency/Canonical_Privacy_Contract.md`
   - Legal review required for production.
- **601 / FIX-10** `docs/Transparency/VERIFY.md`
   - Provide sample commands/responses.

   - Expand with actual API calls or code samples.
- **603 / FIX-10** `docs/Website-Audit-Report.md`

   - Could be automated via reminders; ensure doc stays current.
- **609 / FIX-10** `docs/runbooks/SLOS_AND_ALERTS.md`
   - Should tie to Prometheus alert doc for single source.
- **610 / FIX-11** `src/controllers/adapter.controller.ts`
   - Config blobs accepted as arbitrary JSON without schema validation, enabling invalid adapter credentials; consider per-adapter schema enforcement plus audit logging.
- **611 / FIX-11** `src/services/thompsonSamplingService.ts`
   - Per-process Map state drifts across instances, RNG relies on `Math.random()` without seeding, win/loss updates ignore revenue, price buckets are fixed, and no validation/rate limiting guards `updateBidFloor`.
- **612 / FIX-11** `src/controllers/rtbTracking.controller.ts`
   - Click redirect defaults to `/` without rate limiting, and silent catch blocks hide dedupe failures—tighten logging.
- **613 / FIX-11** `src/services/__tests__/fraudDetection.test.ts`
   - Tests only cover happy-path formatting; add repository exception cases, localization gaps, and pagination/sorting edge cases.
- **614 / FIX-11** `src/services/__tests__/skadnetworkService.test.ts`
   - No crypto verification or concurrency coverage; postback tests skip rate limiting/replay prevention and rely on shared state between cases.
- **615 / FIX-11** `src/services/consentManagementService.ts`
   - Parsers partially implemented, file too large, and lacks rate limiting/log sanitization for large payloads.
- **616 / FIX-11** `src/services/migrationComparisonSigner.ts`
   - Falls back to ephemeral keys, metrics rely on heuristics, and no input validation or key rotation enforcement.
- **617 / FIX-11** `src/services/migrationImportConnectors.ts`
   - Entirely mocked integrations; replace with real HTTP clients, credential validation, and rate limiting.
- **618 / FIX-11** `src/services/reportingService.ts`

   - Stores data in-memory, no Apple signature verification, and lacks persistence/rate limiting for postbacks.
- **622 / FIX-11** `src/controllers/FinancialReportingController.ts`
   - Uses `console.error`, breaks encapsulation by reading private fields, and exposes unauthenticated workbook exports.
- **623 / FIX-11** `src/controllers/abTesting.controller.ts`
   - `recordEvent` skips auth and payload size limits; consider extracting `interpretSignificanceResult` utility.

   - Lacks runtime validation and assumes DOM `AbortSignal` exists.
- **640 / FIX-11** `src/services/rtb/orchestrator.ts`
   - `Promise.all` pattern wastes resources on slow adapters, inputs trust in-process secrets, and config reloads require restarts.

## Infra Migration Prod‑Readiness Audit — 2025‑11‑25

Objective
- Ensure the repository is production‑ready and aligned with the updated Infra Migration Plan (FRA1 + TLS + Postgres‑first, Redis self‑hosted), with no critical stubs/scaffolding left in prod paths. This audit is infra/docs only — no business logic changes.

Verified present and wired (no action needed)
- Nginx configs
  - infrastructure/nginx/apexmediation.conf — HTTP reverse proxy with `/health` and `/metrics` locations; includes commented examples for metrics protection (IP allowlist or Basic Auth).
  - infrastructure/nginx/apexmediation.ssl.conf — HTTPS server blocks split out for enablement after certificates exist on the droplet.
  - infrastructure/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf — Hardened TLS params with HSTS commented until A/A+ validation.
  - infrastructure/nginx/snippets/metrics-basic-auth.conf — Optional Basic Auth snippet for `/metrics`.
- Docker Compose (prod)
  - infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml — Exposes port 80 only; 443 and SSL config mount are commented until certs exist; Redis not publicly exposed; optional htpasswd and certs mounts present.
- Environment templates
  - infrastructure/production/.env.backend.example — FRA1 posture; Postgres `sslmode=require` noted.
  - infrastructure/production/.env.console.example — `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.apexmediation.ee/api/v1`.
- Backend verification scripts
  - backend/scripts/verifyDb.ts — `npm run verify:db`.
  - backend/scripts/verifyRedis.ts — `npm run verify:redis`.
  - backend/scripts/verifyStorage.ts — `npm run verify:storage` (S3‑compatible PUT/HEAD/GET/DELETE).
- Backups
  - scripts/backup/pg_dump_s3_template.sh — Env‑driven Postgres → S3‑compatible backup with optional custom endpoint (Spaces FRA1) and DRY_RUN.

Must‑fix items (prod paths)
- None identified in infra/compose/nginx/env‑templates/verify scripts at this time. All referenced artifacts in the Infra Plan exist and are reachable.

Backlog (to execute per Plan; not blockers pre‑DO)
- Enable HSTS only after external TLS validation (SSL Labs A/A+).
- Upptime status page (`status.apexmediation.ee`) once domains are set and DO is live.
- DO Monitoring alert policies (CPU/RAM/Disk/unreachable) after droplet provisioning.
- Quarterly PITR drill on a staging clone once Managed Postgres is provisioned.

Notes
- Large repository TODOs exist across various documentation and third‑party code (SDKs, vendored test data). These are non‑prod‑path and out of scope for the infra readiness gate. We will keep them tracked separately in documentation backlogs.
