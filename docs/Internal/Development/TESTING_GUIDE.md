---

## Data Flow Testing

### Mock API Integration

- [ ] Placements page fetches placement list
- [ ] Adapters page fetches adapter list
- [ ] Fraud page fetches stats and alerts
- [ ] Payouts page fetches history and upcoming
- [ ] All requests use `/api/mock?endpoint=...`

### React Query Caching
- [ ] Data persists on navigation
- [ ] Refresh button refetches data
- [ ] Loading states only on initial fetch
- [ ] Error handling shows user-friendly messages

---

## Error Scenarios

### Test These Cases
- [ ] Navigate without login → redirects to /login
- [ ] Invalid mock endpoint → shows error
- [ ] Network timeout simulation
- [ ] Empty data states
- [ ] Error boundaries catch React errors

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in:
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] ARIA labels on icons
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA

---

## Known Limitations (Mock Mode)

### What Works:
✅ All read operations (GET)
✅ Realistic random data
✅ Loading states and delays
✅ Navigation and routing
✅ Authentication (demo mode)

### What Doesn't Work:
❌ Create/Update/Delete operations (no persistence)
❌ File uploads
❌ Real-time updates
❌ WebSocket connections
❌ Payment processing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
cd console
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Mock API Not Working
Check `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true
```

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
cd console
npm run type-check
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```
