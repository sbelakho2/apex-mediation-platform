## Key SQL Queries

### Check Conversion Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'active' THEN id END)::FLOAT /
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) * 100 as conversion_rate_percent
FROM publishers
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Best Performing Principle
```sql
SELECT * FROM principle_effectiveness 
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Sales Funnel Overview
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_funnel;
```

### Recent Conversions
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  conversion_type,
  mrr_increase,
  days_in_trial,
  primary_influence_principle
FROM sales_conversions
WHERE converted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY converted_at DESC;
```

  email,
  calculate_engagement_score(id) as engagement,
  predict_conversion_probability(id) as probability
FROM publishers
WHERE subscription_status = 'trial';
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Daily Checks (2 minutes)
1. Conversion rate: Target 40-45%
2. Touchpoints sent: Should match trial customer count
3. Any errors in logs: `grep ERROR backend.log | grep Sales`

### Weekly Reviews (5 minutes)
1. Principle effectiveness: Which is winning?
2. A/B test results: Any clear winners?
3. Journey stage distribution: Any bottlenecks?
4. Conversion by day: Is Day 13 push working?

### Monthly Optimization (15 minutes)
1. Run AI optimization: GPT-4o-mini suggestions
2. Implement winning A/B tests
3. Adjust timing based on open rates
4. Refine segmentation

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Low conversion rate (<30%)
**Diagnosis:** Check `principle_effectiveness` table  
**Fix:** Emphasize best-performing principle more

### Issue: Low engagement scores
**Diagnosis:** Check `commitment_milestones` completion rate  
**Fix:** Make onboarding easier, reduce friction

### Issue: High Day 14 churn
**Diagnosis:** Scarcity not triggering urgency  
**Fix:** Strengthen Day 11-13 messaging, add more specificity

### Issue: Touchpoints not sending
**Diagnosis:** Check cron job status  
**Fix:** `ps aux | grep cron-jobs` should show process running
