# Production Readiness Checklist

This is the single, self-contained runbook to take the system to production on DigitalOcean. It consolidates prerequisites, environment materialization, deployment, HTTPS/HSTS, DB/Redis verification, metrics protection, evidence capture, and rollback guidance. Cross-links point to deeper runbooks where needed, but all critical commands are summarized here for operator convenience.

> **DigitalOcean CLI policy:** All cloud interactions below must be executed from Bash using [`doctl`](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/) or the S3-compatible tooling called out in each section. Do not click through the DigitalOcean UI; if a step is missing a CLI, stop and add it here before proceeding.

## Outcomes by the end of this checklist
- Staging stack is online behind Nginx with valid TLS (API required; Console optional) and HSTS enabled for API.
- Backend health/readiness rely exclusively on Postgres + Redis with migrations applied; legacy ClickHouse gating is permanently removed and should never reappear.
- Evidence captured locally for TLS/HSTS and local health snapshot.
- Sandbox org/apps/placements exist; Android test app validated end-to-end; matrix items progressed in order.
- Load/soak, billing usage, and VRA tests planned and executable with clear acceptance criteria.

## Prerequisites (one-time)
- [X] Domain configured: `api.apexmediation.ee`, `console.apexmediation.ee` (TTL 300s)
- [X] DigitalOcean account with billing enabled
- [X] Install and authenticate `doctl`: `brew install doctl && doctl auth init --context Apex-project`
- [X] Provisioning decisions documented (FRA1, droplet size 2 vCPU/4GB/80GB, DO Managed Postgres Basic/Dev)
- [X] SSH keypair for deploy user created and stored in a local encrypted vault (KeePassXC or `pass`)
- [X] GitHub repo secrets prepared (add when ready): `DROPLET_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`
- [X] Production `.env` templates reviewed:
  - Backend: `infrastructure/production/.env.backend.example` (requires `?sslmode=require`)
  - Console: `infrastructure/production/.env.console.example`
- [X] Evidence tooling verified locally: `scripts/ops/local_health_snapshot.sh`, `scripts/ops/do_tls_snapshot.sh`
- [X] Clone repo to `/home/deploy/` on the droplet
- [X] Materialize `.env` files from templates (do not commit secrets)
- [X] Start stack HTTP-only: `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` and verify `http://<ip>/health`
- [X] Issue certs with certbot, mount `/etc/letsencrypt`, enable `infrastructure/nginx/apexmediation.ssl.conf`, expose 443
- [X] From your laptop run: `npm run do:tls` to capture TLS/HSTS evidence

## 0.0 Staging Bring-up and Full Sandbox Matrix

### 0.0.0 Staging Stack Online (HTTP → TLS/HSTS)
- [x] Materialize runtime envs on droplet only (do not commit):
  - `/home/deploy/Ad-Project/infrastructure/production/.env.backend` (Managed Postgres `?sslmode=require` or `no-verify` during staging), Redis URL, secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, optional `CSRF_SECRET`).
- [x] Start core services (backend, redis, postgres) behind Nginx on HTTP (port 80):
  - `NGINX_PORT=80 docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
  - Verify `curl -i http://<ip>/health`.
- [x] Enable TLS for API (and Console when ready):
  - Stop Nginx container, issue certs with certbot on host; mount `/etc/letsencrypt` in Nginx; expose 443 via `docker-compose.override.yml`.
  - Verify `curl -I https://api.apexmediation.ee/health`.
  - Console TLS (when Console service is enabled): either reuse the API cert if SAN includes `console.apexmediation.ee`, or issue a dedicated console cert; verify `curl -I https://console.apexmediation.ee/`.
- [x] Evidence capture: run `npm run do:tls` from laptop and archive artifacts under `docs/Internal/Deployment/do-readiness-YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [x] Nginx dynamic upstreams: proxy to `backend:8080` (and `console:3000`) with Docker DNS resolver to avoid stale-IP 502s.
- [x] Health/Readiness are Postgres + Redis only (legacy ClickHouse gates must stay removed): `/health` OK; `/ready` relies on DB/Redis latency and basic cache checks.
### Post‑DO HTTPS/HSTS Verification (Phase 9)
- [x] Once HTTPS is live, run `scripts/ops/do_tls_snapshot.sh` (or `npm run do:tls`) from your workstation and archive redirects/TLS/HSTS output under `docs/Internal/Deployment/do-readiness-YYYY-MM-DD/`.
- [x] Ensure the bundle contains `verify-redirects.txt`, `verify-tls.txt`, and `verify-hsts.txt` with SSL Labs A/A+ notations (HTTP→HTTPS redirect proof, HTTP/2/TLS 1.3 evidence, Strict-Transport-Security snapshot).
- [x] Keep HSTS commented until the API cert consistently scores A/A+, then re-run the script and capture the enforcement snapshot; rerun the TLS evidence script after each certificate renewal.

### 0.0.1 Environments, Fixtures & Common Test Data
- [x] Provision dedicated staging endpoints (`STAGING_API_BASE`, `STAGING_CONSOLE_BASE`) and an isolated staging database — `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` and `docs/Internal/Deployment/CI_CD_GUIDE.md` define the hosts (`https://api-staging.apexmediation.ee`, `https://console-staging.apexmediation.ee`) plus `STAGING_DATABASE_URL/STAGING_REDIS_URL` secrets the pipeline requires.
- [x] Create sandbox org **Apex Sandbox Studio** with Android, iOS, Unity, Android TV/CTV, and tvOS apps. *(Seed via managed Postgres using `postgres://doadmin@apexmediation-db-do-user-29825488-0.m.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/apexmediation?sslmode=no-verify`.)*
  - Publisher ID `138f62be-5cee-4c73-aba4-ba78ea77ab44` now exists in `publishers`.
  - App inventory (all tied to the publisher above):

    | Platform          | App Name                       | Bundle ID                    | App ID                                 |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Android           | Apex Sandbox Android           | `com.apex.sandbox.android`   | `7bcfc807-1834-4d69-a1ca-27e258f4ce75` |
    | iOS               | Apex Sandbox iOS               | `com.apex.sandbox.ios`       | `6b8213e3-b331-40b8-a32f-2bac1678e737` |
    | Unity             | Apex Sandbox Unity             | `com.apex.sandbox.unity`     | `26c1c1eb-9fe1-4d3d-9218-6a2d863d57ac` |
    | Android TV / CTV  | Apex Sandbox Android TV/CTV    | `com.apex.sandbox.androidtv` | `3a6dac72-aa81-44af-909c-5b48ab9cbe67` |
    | tvOS              | Apex Sandbox tvOS              | `com.apex.sandbox.tvos`      | `f79cd436-751a-4e26-b2cc-298d1029f794` |

  - Verification: `docker run --rm -e PGPASSWORD=$DOADMIN_PASS postgres:16 psql 'sslmode=require host=apexmediation-db-do-user-29825488-0.m.db.ondigitalocean.com port=25060 user=doadmin dbname=apexmediation' -c "SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) apps FROM apps WHERE publisher_id='138f62be-5cee-4c73-aba4-ba78ea77ab44' GROUP BY 1;"`
- [x] Give every app at least two interstitial placements, two rewarded placements, and one banner slot with consistent IDs. *(Insert all 25 placements using the `sandbox-<platform>-<type>-<nn>` naming convention so they can be referenced in SDK configs.)*

- [x] Stand up FakeNetworkA (always fill), FakeNetworkB (random fill/no-fill), and FakeNetworkC (slow/timeout) plus Starter (~$3k), Growth (~$50k), and Scale (~$150k) revenue scripts. *(Run `npm run sandbox:bootstrap --workspace backend` to upsert adapters/configs/waterfalls + sandbox logins/Stripe, then `npm run sandbox:revenue:starter|growth|scale --workspace backend` to synthesize 30-day revenue (~$3k, ~$50k, ~$150k) across all placements. Scripts are idempotent and scoped to publisher `138f62be-5cee-4c73-aba4-ba78ea77ab44`; use `--dry-run`/`--keep-history` flags when needed.)*
- [x] Issue staging logins (`owner@`, `dev@`, `finance@apex-sandbox.test`) and enable Stripe test mode with customer + card/ACH/SEPA methods. *(Same bootstrap script hashes deterministic passwords (override via `SANDBOX_USER_PASSWORD`), seeds the three users, and provisions a Stripe test customer with 4242 card + `btok_us_verified` (ACH) + `btok_sepa_debit`. Follow up by sending Resend invites if you need fresh magic links.)*
- [x] Ensure every SDK build (Android, iOS, Unity, tvOS/CTV, Web) ships adapters for every network API/SDK in scope (FakeNetworkA/B/C + partner networks) so request/response parity is validated end-to-end — captured in `docs/Adapters/SUPPORTED_NETWORKS.md` and the adapters inventory section of `docs/Internal/SANDBOX_TESTING_READINESS_2025-11-13.md` (all 15 partner networks stubbed across platforms).

### 0.0.2 Android Test App – Full E2E SDK Sandbox
- [x] Ship debug-only **ApexSandboxAndroid** with SDK status panel, Init/Load/Show buttons, GDPR/CCPA/LAT toggles, and rolling request log.
- [x] Pass happy-path flows: single initialize call, interstitial/rewarded load→show→callback order, banners refresh without layout issues.
- [x] Exercise error states: airplane mode, FakeNetworkB no-fill, FakeNetworkC timeout, and invalid placement IDs without crashes.
- [x] Stress lifecycle: rotation, background/foreground swaps, rapid Show spam → ensure one show at a time and consistent callbacks.
- [x] Flip consent/privacy toggles (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, LAT, test mode) and confirm metadata in staging logs.
- [x] Run a 30-minute soak cycling placements; verify no ANRs, crashes, or runaway memory in Android Studio profiler.

### 0.0.3 iOS Test App – Full E2E SDK Sandbox
- [x] Build **ApexSandboxiOS** with Init/Load/Show buttons, consent/ATT toggles, and debug overlay (config version, request ID, last error).
- [x] Confirm `MediationSDK.initialize` idempotency plus clean interstitial/rewarded callback sequences.
- [x] Validate error handling for Wi-Fi drop, invalid placement IDs, and FakeNetworkC timeout; UI stays responsive.
- [x] Stress lifecycle: background mid-load, orientation change, rapid Show taps → no duplicate presenters or crashes.
- [x] Simulate ATT allow/deny plus GDPR/CCPA toggles and confirm outbound metadata updates.
- [x] Complete 30-minute soak run with Crashlytics instrumentation and zero crashes/memory leaks.

Implementation/validation guide (iOS)

Prerequisites
- [X] macOS 14+ (Sonoma), Xcode 16.x with iOS 17+ simulators installed
- [X] Apple Developer Team (for on-device runs; not required for Simulator)
- [X] CocoaPods 1.15+

Project layout
- Create the test app under: `Test Apps/ApexSandboxiOS/`
  - `ApexSandboxiOS.xcodeproj` (or `.xcworkspace` if using CocoaPods)
  - Targets: `ApexSandboxiOS` (app)
  - Bundle ID suggestion: `ee.apexmediation.sandbox.ios`
  - Deployment target: iOS 15.0+
  - Architectures: arm64 + x86_64 (for Simulator via Rosetta where applicable)

SDK integration
- via CocoaPods:
  - Create `Podfile` in `Test Apps/ApexSandboxiOS/`:
    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '15.0'
    use_frameworks!
    target 'ApexSandboxiOS' do
      pod 'MediationSDK', :path => '../../sdk/ios' # adjust path or use remote spec when published
      # Optional: Crashlytics
      pod 'Firebase/Crashlytics'
    end
    ```
  - Run `pod install` and open the workspace

UI and debug overlay
- Main screen controls (create with UIKit or SwiftUI):
  - [x] Initialize (one button)
  - [x] Load Interstitial, Show Interstitial (two buttons)
  - [x] Load Rewarded, Show Rewarded (two buttons)
  - [x] Consent toggles: GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, Test mode
  - [x] ATT toggle (triggers ATT prompt or simulates allow/deny in Simulator)
  - [x] Debug overlay (non-blocking): shows config version, last request ID, last error code/message, and current consent/ATT states

Initialize + idempotency
- Expected behavior:
  - Multiple `MediationSDK.initialize(context:options:)` calls are safe (no crash, no duplicate observers); subsequent calls are no-ops.
  - Logs include a single SDK version banner; subsequent calls log "already initialized".
- Steps:
  - [x] Tap Initialize multiple times; verify only one initialization path is executed.
  - [x] Confirm callbacks or readiness notifications fire once.

Interstitial/Rewarded flows
- Expected behavior:
  - Clean callback sequences: `onLoad → onShow → onClick? → onClose` with no duplicates, exactly once per show.
  - Show blocked if not loaded; Show after load succeeds; subsequent load allowed post‑close.
- Steps:
  - [x] Load Interstitial → Show → verify callback order and no duplicates
  - [x] Load Rewarded → Show → verify reward callback and dismissal

Error handling validations
- Wi‑Fi drop:
  - [x] Disable Network Link Conditioner or turn off Wi‑Fi in Simulator during load
  - Expect: `onLoadFailed(timeout/network)` no UI freeze; retry works after network returns
- Invalid placement IDs:
  - [x] Use an intentionally invalid placement, expect immediate error and readable message
- FakeNetworkC timeout (if test adapter available):
  - [x] Toggle FakeNetworkC and verify timeout path; app UI stays responsive

Lifecycle stress tests
- [x] Background app mid‑load; return and ensure no crashes; pending load either times out or resumes per SDK design
- [x] Rotate device (portrait↔landscape) during load/show; no duplicate presenters; orientation respected when showing
- [x] Rapid "Show" taps while an ad is already presenting; ensure only one presentation occurs and additional taps are ignored/debounced

ATT + consent toggles
- [x] Simulator: Features → Privacy → Tracking → Reset (then request again)
- [x] Present ATT request via SDK or app; test both allow/deny
- [x] Toggle GDPR/CCPA/COPPA; confirm outbound metadata updates (inspect network console or SDK debug logs)

30‑minute soak run with Crashlytics
- Setup (optional but recommended):
  - [x] Add Firebase (Crashlytics) to the app; initialize on launch; verify a test log appears in Firebase console
- Soak procedure:
  - [x] Start a 30‑minute loop: Load→Show interstitial, then Load→Show rewarded; rotate device every 2–3 minutes; background/foreground twice
  - [x] Monitor Xcode memory graph; ensure no runaway memory
  - [x] Expect zero crashes and no ANRs; Crashlytics should remain empty for fatal/non‑fatal issues

Evidence capture (store under repo)
- Directory: `docs/Internal/QA/ios-sandbox/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`
  - [ ] `screenshots/` (initialization, consent toggles, ATT prompt, debug overlay, callback console)
  - [ ] `videos/` short clips of load/show flows and lifecycle stress
  - [ ] `logs/console.txt` exported from Xcode (filter by MediationSDK tag)
  - [ ] `results.json` with summary: SDK version, iOS version/device, pass/fail for each checklist item

Acceptance criteria
- [x] Initialize idempotent (no duplicate observers; single version banner)
- [x] Interstitial and Rewarded flows deliver exactly-once callback sequences
- [x] App remains responsive during network loss/timeout/invalid placement tests
- [x] No crashes under lifecycle stress; no duplicate presenters
- [x] ATT + GDPR/CCPA toggles reflect in outbound metadata
- [x] 30‑minute soak: zero crashes, stable memory profile

Notes
- Use a dedicated sandbox API org and apps/placements mirroring Android sandbox to keep parity across platforms.
- If the SDK provides a Mediation Debugger, expose an entry in the sandbox app to open it and capture a screenshot in the evidence bundle.

### 0.0.4 Unity Test Project – Multi-Platform SDK Sandbox
- [x] Create **ApexSandboxUnity** (single-scene) with Init, Load/Show Interstitial, Load/Show Rewarded, optional Banner, and status console.
- [x] Export Android and iOS builds; ensure Unity wrapper wiring matches native SDK versions.
- [x] Verify Unity callbacks fire exactly once per show and map errors (no-fill/timeout/network) into Unity enums/strings.
- [x] Ensure Unity consent toggles propagate down to native layers (check staging logs) and that placement IDs/configs match mobile builds.

### 0.0.5 Android TV / CTV Test App
- [x] Build **ApexSandboxCTV-Android** with remote-friendly focus UI and full-screen ad surface (1080p + 4K).
- [x] Validate SDK init plus interstitial/rewarded load+show on real Android TV/Fire TV hardware or emulator; Back button dismisses gracefully.
- [x] Confirm lifecycle resilience (Home → other app → return) and smooth handling of Ethernet/Wi-Fi toggles mid-load.
- [x] Ensure logging tags requests with `platform=android_tv` (or similar) for analytics segmentation.

### 0.0.6 tvOS / CTV Test App
- [x] Build **ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS** with focus-driven UI (Init, Show Interstitial, Show Rewarded) and test on Apple TV.
- [x] Confirm show flows mirror iOS while respecting TV navigation semantics (one presentation at a time).
- [x] Test background/foreground transitions and rapid button presses without crashes; verify logs carry `platform=tvos`.

Implementation/validation guide (tvOS / Apple TV)

Prerequisites
- [x] macOS 14+ with Xcode 16.x (tvOS 17+ simulators installed)
- [x] Apple TV 4K (3rd generation) simulator; physical Apple TV optional for final pass
- [x] XcodeGen (`brew install xcodegen`) and the shared staging credentials/placements noted in `Sources/SandboxConfig.json`

Project layout
- `Test Apps/tvos/ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS/` powered by `project.yml`
- SwiftUI-driven UI (`Sources/ContentView.swift`) plus `SandboxViewModel` for SDK wiring, single-presenter guardrails, and `platform=tvos` logging
- UIKit presenter helper (`Sources/UIKit+TopVC.swift`) to ensure ads use the current top-most controller

Build & run
1. `cd "Test Apps/tvos/ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS"`
2. `xcodegen generate && open ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS.xcodeproj`
3. Select **Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)** simulator (tvOS 17.2+) or attach a physical Apple TV dev kit
4. Update `Sources/SandboxConfig.json` with staging app/placement IDs before each run
5. Optional: `xcodebuild -scheme ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS -destination "platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)"` for CI smoke

Validation script
- Initialize idempotency: spam **Initialize**; console shows the single SDK banner plus "initialize already" on repeats
- Load/Show Interstitial & Rewarded: ensure only one presentation at a time; look for `AdPresentationCoordinator` "show blocked" log when tapping Show twice
- Remote & focus controls: walk all buttons with the Siri Remote (Up/Down/Left/Right/Select) and verify focus ring wraps; **Menu/Back long-press** should dismiss overlays cleanly and return focus to the first button row
- Lifecycle stress: `Cmd+Shift+H` (Home) then re-enter, trigger sleep/wake, and confirm state + presenter queues survive; logs should show `backgrounded` / `foregrounded`
- Network/error states: toggle macOS Network Link Conditioner (offline, high-latency) or disconnect simulator networking; verify FakeNetworkB/C behaviors surface readable errors without UI jank
- Telemetry/log review: capture Xcode console output to confirm `platform=tvos` tags on init/load/show/close and that consent/privacy flags propagate to the request metadata block

Evidence capture
- Record a short video per scenario via `xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo tvos-focus-loop.mp4` (stop with Ctrl+C) plus screenshots of the debug overlay/state panel
- Export Xcode console logs (`File → Save...)` and sanitize before committing
- Store assets under `docs/Internal/QA/tvos-sandbox/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` with `videos/`, `screenshots/`, `logs/console.txt`, and a `results.json` summarizing device, tvOS version, SDK commit, and pass/fail notes
- Link the evidence folder back in this checklist (Section 0.0.6 and 0.0.14) once each run is archived

### 0.0.7 Console & Dashboard Sandbox Tests
- [ ] Run signup/login/password-reset flows on staging console; confirm verification emails via Resend and session handling.
- [ ] Create org/apps through UI, generate API keys, and verify persistence in DB plus availability in staging SDK configs.
- [ ] CRUD placements with validation (no duplicates, required fields) and confirm propagation to test apps.
- [ ] Configure FakeNetworkA/B/C adapters (placeholders only), ensure secrets never log, and toggle per-placement enablement.
- [ ] Validate dashboards: revenue/eCPM/fill charts show sandbox data, drill-down + time-range filters work, and widgets stay in sync.
- [ ] Exercise Mediation Debugger entries from sandbox apps; inspect timelines/no-bid reasons, confirm pagination + filters + PII redaction.
- [ ] Surface network auction logs and/or hashed bid/commitment payloads per request so publishers can export evidence (meets transparency pledges); verify SDKs stream these artifacts and console exposes filters/downloads.
- [ ] Validate end-to-end transparency exports and redaction: cross-check exported CSV/JSON against `docs/Internal/Transparency/DATA_FLOW_AND_COMPLIANCE.md` (hashing/salting rules, no raw device IDs without lawful basis). Ensure operators can access per-request `auction_root`, `bid_commitment`, reasons, and clearing price without PII.

Postgres-only analytics/readiness (from migration plan and changelog):
- Reporting, quality monitoring, transparency, billing usage, and export APIs read from Postgres fact tables and replicas. No ClickHouse dependency.
- `/ready` reports Postgres/Redis health (latency, replica lag, cache hit), not ClickHouse; alerts/dashboards track replica lag and query budgets.

### 0.0.8 Website / Landing Page Sandbox Tests
- [ ] Deploy staging marketing site (e.g., `staging.apexmediation.ee`) and verify `/`, `/pricing`, `/docs`, `/legal/*` routes 
- [ ] Confirm navigation, signup redirect into staging console, and “Request demo” form delivering to Resend/CRM sandbox.
- [x] Check content parity: BYO tiers (Starter 0%, Growth 2.5%, Scale 2.0%, Enterprise 1–1.5%) and no legacy managed-demand copy (see `website/src/app/%5B...slug%5D/page.tsx` “Fees & payment terms” section referencing the exact tier percentages).
- [x] Run website security header/unit suite: `npm --prefix website run test` to confirm HSTS + CSP coverage under `website/src/__tests__/security.headers.test.js`.
- [ ] Perform responsive sweep (desktop/tablet/360px mobile) to ensure no layout overlap or broken sections.
- [ ] Validate title/meta/canonical tags plus custom 404 behavior and absence of broken links.

### 0.0.9 Billing, Usage & Stripe Sandbox Tests
- [ ] Generate synthetic usage for Starter (<$10k), Growth (~$50k), and Scale (~$150k) apps; run aggregation job and confirm tier assignments.
- [ ] Trip Starter cap by exceeding $10k to ensure backend flips `requires_payment_method` and console shows upgrade banner/feature blocks.
- [ ] Create Stripe test customer, send metered events, finalize invoice, and confirm webhook transitions local invoice (open→paid) and PDF shows Bel Consulting OÜ + Wise SEPA/ACH text.
- [ ] Use Stripe Customer Portal link from console to add test card, run charge, and verify states in Stripe + console UI.
- [ ] Send “upcoming invoice”, “invoice paid”, and “payment failed” email previews; assert plan/dollar amounts and Resend logs.
- [ ] Simulate payment failure to test dunning job, console status transitions, and notification fan-out.

### 0.0.10 VRA / Reconciliation Sandbox Tests
- [ ] Run multi-day sandbox traffic (impressions/clicks/paid events) and craft matching, under-reported, and FX-mismatched network statements.
- [ ] Execute VRA pipeline; verify `recon_statements_norm`, `recon_expected`, `recon_match`, and `recon_deltas` contain correct classifications.
- [ ] Review console VRA overview metrics, deltas filtering (app/network/date), and dispute-kit ZIP (CSV + receipt summary).
- [ ] Validate Proof-of-Revenue: daily roots + monthly digest generation plus hash verification tooling.
 - [ ] Cross‑reference `docs/Internal/VRA/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for expected table names, flows, and evidence examples.

### 0.0.11 Cron Jobs, Emails & Automation (Staging)
- [ ] Run staging cron/worker stack (usage aggregation daily, Stripe sync, email queue) and confirm zero crashes in logs.
- [ ] Verify failure alerting for jobs, plus render sandbox-triggered emails in test inboxes.

### 0.0.12 Light Load & Soak Test (End-to-End)
- [ ] Drive 1–5 RPS `loadAd` + reporting traffic via script/k6/Gatling for ≥1 hour across sandbox apps.
- [ ] Keep API p95 within targets, error rate <1%, low Sentry noise, and stable CPU/memory on staging droplet.
- [ ] Capture heap/CPU snapshots and export Grafana/Prometheus panels for run evidence.

### 0.0.13 Final Readiness Gate (system operational + tested)
- [ ] 0.0.0 complete: HTTP → TLS/HSTS (API), evidence archived; Console TLS verified or consciously deferred.
- [ ] 0.0.1 seeded: org/apps/placements present; migrations applied; readiness `/ready` green (Postgres + Redis only).
- [ ] 0.0.2 Android app green: happy path, errors, lifecycle, 30‑minute soak.
- [ ] Website, Billing, VRA, Cron/Automation checkpoints planned or executed as applicable; any deferred items are tracked with owners/dates.
- [ ] Rollback/runbook documented; on‑call dashboards and alerts show the new Postgres‑only signals (replica lag, cache hit, query p95).

### 0.0.14 SDK Privacy, Lifecycle & Observability Audit
 - [x] Privacy & identifiers
  - [x] iOS: enforce ATT gating for IDFA (MediationSDK v1.0.0 ATT manager + `BelAds.requestTrackingAuthorization()` helpers), guarantee zero IDFA when status ≠ authorized, wire SKAdNetwork participation + SKOverlay presenter per `Privacy/SKAdNetworkCoordinator.swift`, and document the SKAN 4 coarse mapping/metadata contract under `docs/Developer-Facing/SKAN_COARSE_MAPPING.md`.
  - [x] Android: latest UMP wrapper + GAID/App Set fallbacks ship via `ConsentManager`/`PrivacyIdentifierProvider`, system privacy sliders feed into `PrivacySandboxStateProvider`, and `AuctionClient` now forwards privacy sandbox + identifier metadata (GAID when LAT off, App Set fallback otherwise) to keep S2S payloads aligned with user-level toggles.
  - [x] Global: propagate COPPA/child-directed flags, CCPA US Privacy Strings, and GDPR TCF v2 strings to every network adapter consistently; keep automated coverage in `swift test`, `./gradlew.sh testDebugUnitTest`, and `DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet8 dotnet test sdk/core/unity/Tests/ApexMediation.Tests.csproj` to validate outbound payloads.
 - [x] Lifecycle & threading
  - [x] iOS/tvOS: guarantee main-thread UI presentation only (Scene-based apps & multi-scene), block double presentations, cancel timers/observers on background, and avoid presenter retain cycles; cover via `AdPresentationCoordinator` plus `swift test` suites.
  - [x] Android/CTV: `runtime/AdPresentationCoordinator.kt` tracks foreground Activities via `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`, blocks concurrent shows, waits for resumed Activities before invoking `BelInterstitial/Rewarded/RewardedInterstitial/AppOpen`, and defers execution when the process backgrounds; enforce via `./gradlew.sh testDebugUnitTest` (`AdPresentationCoordinatorTest` + OM SDK facades).
  - [x] Unity: `MediationSDK.InternalShow` routes every native `show` callback through the Unity `EventPump`, guards against duplicate platform invocations, and records telemetry once; keep `MediationSdkShowTests` in `sdk/core/unity/Tests` green under `DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet8 dotnet test`.
- [ ] Error states & networking
  - [ ] Map no-fill/HTTP 204, timeouts, 429 rate limits (Retry-After), 5xx retries/backoff, and navigation cancellations deterministically with exponential backoff + circuit breaker guards.
    - [x] Android SDK: `sdk/core/android/src/main/kotlin/network/AuctionClient.kt` applies deterministic exponential backoff, circuit breaker gating, explicit 429 `rate_limited` taxonomy (parsing `Retry-After`), and navigation-cancel detection, all covered in `sdk/core/android/src/test/kotlin/network/AuctionClientTest.kt` via `./gradlew.sh testDebugUnitTest`.
    - [x] iOS/tvOS: extend `sdk/core/ios/Tests` with deterministic HTTP 204/429/5xx/timeouts coverage plus retry/circuit-breaker assertions (`AuctionClientErrorTests.swift`, `AuctionClientTests.swift`, `AdCacheBehaviorTests.swift`); see `CHANGELOG.md` (2025-12-07) for commands and evidence locations.
    - [x] Unity: add coverage in `sdk/core/unity/Tests/Networking/NetworkingErrorSurfaceTests.cs` validating the C# bridge surfaces `NoFill`, `Timeout`, `RateLimited`, and retriable server failures; run `$HOME/.dotnet8/dotnet test sdk/core/unity/Tests/ApexMediation.Tests.csproj` and store the latest log under `docs/Internal/QA/unity-network-errors-2025-12-07/dotnet-test.log`.
  - [ ] Exercise airplane mode, captive portals, DNS failures, and Wi-Fi/Ethernet/Cell flips mid-load to prove graceful recovery.
    - [x] Android SDK: Added targeted scenarios in `sdk/core/android/src/test/kotlin/network/AuctionClientTest.kt` (`airplaneMode_connectFailure_retriesAndMapsNetworkError`, `dnsFailure_unknownHost_retriesAndMapsNetworkError`, `captivePortal_redirect_mapsStatus302WithoutRetry`, and `networkFlip_disconnectAfterRequest_recoversOnRetry`) covering simulated airplane/DNS outages, captive portal redirects, and mid-load network flips; exercised via `./gradlew.sh testDebugUnitTest`.
    - [x] iOS/tvOS: document simulator runs toggling airplane mode, DNS overrides, and captive portal proxies mid-load while the sandbox apps remain responsive; see `CHANGELOG.md` (2025-12-07 “iOS/tvOS Network Failure Evidence”) for artifact paths.
    - [ ] Unity: run the macOS play mode harness with `NetworkEmulationBehaviour` toggles (offline, high-latency, captive portal) and export the Unity console log demonstrating graceful retries.
- [x] Caching & state
  - [x] Validate bid/ad object expiry, show-once semantics, one-ad-at-a-time guarantees, cold vs warm cache behavior, and banner refresh timing/back-to-back load+show sequences.
    - Android: auction/runtime cache contract covered in `sdk/core/android/src/test/kotlin/runtime/AdCacheTest.kt` + `AuctionClientLoadShowTest.kt`; keep `./gradlew.sh testDebugUnitTest` in CI for evidence.
    - iOS: deterministic overrides feed `sdk/core/ios/Tests/Runtime/AdCacheBehaviorTests.swift` to assert claim-once + TTL eviction while UISmoke harness drives warm-cache reloads; validate with `swift test` under `sdk/core/ios`.
    - Unity: single-use guarantees and expiry replacement scenarios live in `sdk/core/unity/Tests/RenderableAdTests.cs`; confirm via `DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet8 dotnet test sdk/core/unity/Tests/ApexMediation.Tests.csproj`.
    - tvOS: dedicated `sdk/ctv/tvos/Tests/CTVSDKTests/AdCacheTests.swift` mirrors the shared semantics (peek vs take, expiry purge, replacement) and runs via `xcodebuild test -scheme CTVSDK -destination "platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)"`.
- [ ] Platform-specific polish
  - [ ] tvOS: drive `Test Apps/ApexSandboxCTV-tvOS` on Apple TV 4K simulator (and physical Apple TV if available), record video proving focus engine loops, Menu/back long-press dismissal, and single-presenter enforcement (look for `AdPresentationCoordinator` "show blocked" log). Store evidence under `docs/Internal/QA/tvos-sandbox/<date>/`.
  - [ ] CTV (Android TV/Fire TV): run the Android TV/Fire TV sandbox build on 1080p + 4K hardware/emulators, capture screenshots of safe-area/overscan compliance, demonstrate remote key-repeat spam tolerance, and include adb logcat excerpts tagged with `platform=android_tv` inside `docs/Internal/QA/androidtv-sandbox/<date>/`.
- [ ] Observability
  - [ ] Publish a redaction matrix (`docs/Internal/Observability/log-redaction-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) mapping every log field to `hash`, `truncate`, or `drop`, and include sanitized sample log lines showing adapter-level telemetry for auction reasons/no-bids.
  - [ ] Export the `/ready` alert path: Grafana panels + Alertmanager rules for Postgres replica lag and Redis cache-hit thresholds, plus `npm run test:infra` output proving the alerts fire; archive artifacts under `docs/Monitoring/evidence/<date>/` and link them here once captured.

## Appendix A — Infrastructure Setup (Provisioning from scratch)
If you are provisioning a brand‑new droplet and managed services, follow this section. If a droplet already exists, use 0.0.0 above and skip this appendix.

### A.1 Compute — Main App Droplet (DigitalOcean)
- [ ] Confirm CLI access (reuse the prerequisite step if already complete):
  ```bash
  export DIGITALOCEAN_CONTEXT=apex-prod
  doctl auth switch --context "$DIGITALOCEAN_CONTEXT"
  doctl account get
  ```
- [ ] Provision droplet `apex-core-1` (Basic Regular/Premium, 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM / 80 GB SSD, Ubuntu 22.04+, region near FRA/AMS/NYC) directly from Bash:
  ```bash
  export DO_REGION=fra1
  export DROPLET_NAME=apex-core-1
  export DROPLET_SIZE=s-2vcpu-4gb
  export DROPLET_IMAGE=ubuntu-22-04-x64
  export SSH_KEY_ID=$(doctl compute ssh-key list --format ID --no-header | head -n 1)
  doctl compute droplet create "$DROPLET_NAME" \
    --region "$DO_REGION" \
    --image "$DROPLET_IMAGE" \
    --size "$DROPLET_SIZE" \
    --ssh-keys "$SSH_KEY_ID" \
    --tag-names apex,production \
    --vpc-uuid $(doctl vpcs list --format ID --no-header | head -n 1) \
    --wait
  export DROPLET_ID=$(doctl compute droplet list "$DROPLET_NAME" --format ID --no-header)
  export DROPLET_IP=$(doctl compute droplet list "$DROPLET_NAME" --format PublicIPv4 --no-header)
  ```
- [ ] Harden the server (non-root user, disable password SSH, key-only auth, enable UFW 22/80/443, install fail2ban, enable unattended-upgrades).
- [ ] Install Docker and docker-compose.
- [ ] Define `docker-compose.yml` with `api`, `console`, `redis`, `nginx` services; expose only Nginx on 80/443.
- [ ] Configure Nginx routing for `api.apexmediation.ee`, `console.apexmediation.ee`.

#### A.1.1 HTTPS/HSTS Verification
Follow section 0.0.0 for TLS/HSTS enablement and evidence capture; do not duplicate steps here. Protect `/metrics` via IP allowlist or Basic Auth snippet as part of Nginx HTTPS server blocks.

### A.2 Database — Managed PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL cluster (Basic/Dev plan, same region, 10–20 GB storage) via CLI:
  ```bash
  export DB_NAME=apex-prod-db
  doctl databases create "$DB_NAME" \
    --engine pg \
    --version 15 \
    --region fra1 \
    --num-nodes 1 \
    --size db-s-1vcpu-1gb
  export DB_ID=$(doctl databases list --format ID,Name --no-header | awk '/apex-prod-db/ {print $1; exit}')
  doctl databases db create "$DB_ID" ad_platform || true
  doctl databases user create "$DB_ID" --name apex_app || true
  doctl databases user create "$DB_ID" --name apex_admin || true
  doctl databases connection "$DB_ID" --format URI --no-header
  ```
- [ ] Restrict access to droplet private IP + admin IPs and enforce SSL.
  ```bash
  export DROPLET_ID=$(doctl compute droplet list apex-core-1 --format ID --no-header)
  export ADMIN_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)
  doctl databases firewall update "$DB_ID" \
    --rule droplet:"$DROPLET_ID" \
    --rule ip:"$ADMIN_IP/32"
  ```
- [ ] Create roles `apex_app` (limited) and `apex_admin` (migrations); store credentials in env/secrets.
- [ ] Port and run migrations (001–008+) against managed Postgres; wire CI deploy script.
- [ ] Verify schema (tables, hot-column indexes, FKs, constraints).
- [ ] Enable automated daily backups and document RPO (24h) / RTO (1–4h); test PITR restore in staging.
- [ ] Build early analytics tables (`daily_app_metrics`, `daily_network_metrics`).
- [ ] Production `DATABASE_URL` enforces TLS: append `?sslmode=require` (verify with `npm run verify:db --workspace backend`)
  ```bash
  export CONN_URI=$(doctl databases connection "$DB_ID" --format URI --no-header)
  psql "${CONN_URI}?sslmode=require" -c 'select current_timestamp;'
  ```

### A.3 Cache — Redis
- [ ] Install Redis (docker `redis:6-alpine` or apt) bound to localhost/Docker network.
- [ ] Configure 512 MB max memory, `allkeys-lru` eviction, `requirepass`, persistence (AOF/RDB).
- [ ] Validate rate limiting, idempotency, and feature flag use cases.
- [ ] Confirm Redis is not publicly reachable (external `nmap <host> -p 6379` → closed/filtered); in‑cluster AUTH works (`npm run verify:redis --workspace backend`).

### 1.4 Object Storage & Backups
- [ ] Primary: Self-hosted MinIO on the droplet (internal network only)
  - S3 endpoint: `http://minio:9000` (private bridge)
  - Bucket: `apex-prod-objects` (private)
  - Access: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (MinIO root/user or scoped user)
- [ ] Offsite (optional): DigitalOcean Spaces replication/sync for offsite copies
  - Endpoint: `https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com`
  - Use `rclone`/`mc mirror` weekly to sync MinIO → Spaces (Day‑2 job)
  ```bash
  export SPACES_ENDPOINT=https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com
  export SPACES_BUCKET=apex-prod-offsite
  aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket "$SPACES_BUCKET" \
    --endpoint-url "$SPACES_ENDPOINT" \
    --acl private || true
  mc alias set do-spaces "$SPACES_ENDPOINT" "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
  mc mirror --overwrite minio/apex-prod-objects do-spaces/"$SPACES_BUCKET"
  ```
- [ ] Enforce signed URLs and lifecycle rules (30–90 days for intermediates) on both targets if used.
- [ ] Schedule weekly/monthly DB exports to MinIO (encrypted) and test restore path.

### 1.5 DigitalOcean Full Production Deployment Plan (End‑to‑End)

This section consolidates the end‑to‑end steps to deploy the production stack on DigitalOcean. It references detailed runbooks elsewhere in this repo and acts as a single sign‑off checklist for going live.

Pre‑flight
- [ ] DNS prepared: `api.apexmediation.ee`, `console.apexmediation.ee` (TTL 300s)
  ```bash
  doctl compute domain create apexmediation.ee || true
  # Requires apex-core-1 to be created; otherwise set DROPLET_IP manually
  export DROPLET_IP=$(doctl compute droplet list apex-core-1 --format PublicIPv4 --no-header)
  doctl compute domain records create apexmediation.ee \
    --record-type A \
    --record-name api \
    --record-data "$DROPLET_IP" \
    --record-ttl 300
  doctl compute domain records create apexmediation.ee \
    --record-type A \
    --record-name console \
    --record-data "$DROPLET_IP" \
    --record-ttl 300
  ```
- [ ] GitHub Actions deploy workflow prepared with DO secrets but kept manual-only until cutover
- [ ] Pause all non-essential GitHub Actions via CLI until go-live:
  ```bash
  gh auth status --hostname github.com
  for wf in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
    gh workflow disable "$(basename "$wf")"
  done
  ```
- [ ] Production environment variables prepared (see `infrastructure/production/.env.backend.example` and `.env.console.example`)

Build & Publish
- [ ] Build backend and console images in CI and push to container registry (GHCR or DOCR)
- [ ] Tag images with immutable version (e.g., git SHA) and “prod” channel

Provision & Harden Droplet
- [ ] Create `apex-core-1` in FRA1 (2 vCPU / 4GB / 80GB)
  ```bash
  export DO_REGION=fra1
  export DROPLET_NAME=apex-core-1
  export DROPLET_SIZE=s-2vcpu-4gb
  export DROPLET_IMAGE=ubuntu-22-04-x64
  export SSH_KEY_ID=$(doctl compute ssh-key list --format ID --no-header | head -n 1)
  doctl compute droplet create "$DROPLET_NAME" \
    --region "$DO_REGION" \
    --size "$DROPLET_SIZE" \
    --image "$DROPLET_IMAGE" \
    --ssh-keys "$SSH_KEY_ID" \
    --tag-names apex,production \
    --wait
  ```
- [ ] Create non-root `deploy` user; harden SSH (key-only); enable UFW (22/80/443)
- [ ] Install Docker + docker compose; clone repo to `/opt/apex`

Environment Materialization
- [ ] Materialize `.env` files on droplet (backend/console) without committing secrets
- [ ] Set `DATABASE_URL` for DO Managed Postgres with `?sslmode=require`
- [ ] Set `REDIS_URL` to private bridge host with password (no public exposure)

Start Stack (HTTP only initially)
- [ ] `docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
- [ ] Verify `GET http://<droplet-ip>/health` via port 80 → 200 OK proxied to backend

Enable HTTPS & Gate HSTS
- [ ] Issue certs with certbot for API/Console on droplet; mount `/etc/letsencrypt`
- [ ] Mount `infrastructure/nginx/apexmediation.ssl.conf` and expose `443` in compose
- [ ] Reload Nginx; verify HTTP→HTTPS redirects and HTTPS headers using `scripts/ops/do_tls_snapshot.sh`
- [ ] Keep HSTS commented until SSL Labs grade A/A+; then enable and verify

Data Plane Verification
- [ ] Database TLS: run `npm run verify:db --workspace backend` and then migrations
- [ ] Redis isolation: `npm run verify:redis --workspace backend` and external `nmap` on `6379` (expect closed/filtered)
- [ ] Protect `/metrics` (Basic Auth or IP allowlist) and capture 401/403 proof

Evidence & Changelog
- [ ] Store evidence under `docs/Internal/Deployment/do-readiness-YYYY-MM-DD/`
- [ ] Add top entry to `CHANGELOG.md` linking the evidence and summarizing verification
- [ ] Keep GitHub Actions paused until go-live approval, then re-enable targeted workflows only:
  ```bash
  gh workflow list --all
  gh workflow enable deploy-production.yml
  ```

Rollback Preparedness
- [ ] Define 5‑minute TTL DNS rollback to previous infra
- [ ] Document clear rollback triggers (latency/error rate/downtime) and operator steps

References
- `docs/Internal/Infrastructure/DO_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `scripts/ops/do_tls_snapshot.sh`, `scripts/ops/local_health_snapshot.sh`
- `infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `infrastructure/nginx/*`

## Final Sign‑off (Go‑Live Gate)
- [ ] HTTPS validated with SSL Labs grade A/A+; HSTS enabled and verified
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` enforces TLS (`?sslmode=require`) and migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Redis not publicly reachable (external nmap shows 6379 closed/filtered); in-cluster AUTH verified
- [ ] `/metrics` protected (401 Basic or 403 IP allowlist) from public Internet
- [ ] Evidence bundle stored under `docs/Internal/Deployment/do-readiness-YYYY-MM-DD/` and referenced in `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] CI “policy guard” green: provider content guard and infra plan tests pass (`npm run test:infra`)

### 1.6 Budget Check
- [ ] Confirm monthly infra spend (droplet ~$24 + Postgres ~$15 + storage ~$5 + misc $3–5 ≤ $50 target).

## 2. Monitoring & Observability
### 2.1 Host & App Monitoring
- [ ] Materialize .env file for monitoring
- [ ] Enable DigitalOcean Monitoring for `apex-core-1` (CPU/RAM/Disk/Network).
  ```bash
  export DROPLET_ID=$(doctl compute droplet list apex-core-1 --format ID --no-header)
  doctl monitoring alert create \
    --type droplet_cpu \
    --description "Apex CPU > 80%" \
    --comparison GreaterThan \
    --value 80 \
    --window 5m \
    --enabled true \
    --entities "$DROPLET_ID" \
    --emails security@apexmediation.ee
  doctl monitoring alert create \
    --type droplet_memory \
    --description "Apex RAM > 80%" \
    --comparison GreaterThan \
    --value 80 \
    --window 5m \
    --enabled true \
    --entities "$DROPLET_ID" \
    --emails security@apexmediation.ee

- [ ] tvOS/CTV: Build verification for Apple TV/Android TV sample apps.
- [ ] Tag releases and attach sample binaries where applicable.
- [ ] CI smoke suites must validate every adapter invokes the corresponding network SDK/API, captures auction logs (win/lose reasons, clearing prices), and emits hashed commitments for transparency export.

### Samples & Integration Guides
- [ ] Provide sample apps for Android, iOS, Unity, and CTV (staging endpoints pre-wired).
- [ ] Ship Quick Start per platform with consent toggles and placement wiring examples.
- [ ] Ensure API Keys/placement IDs can be created via Console and propagate to SDK configs.

## 2. Day‑2 Operations (Long‑Term Running)

This section operationalizes long‑term running of the platform: CI/CD, scheduled jobs (accounting/billing), backups, monitoring/alerting, security hygiene, capacity/cost controls, and clear operator routines. Treat it as your primary ops playbook post‑launch.

### 2.1 CI/CD & Release Management
- [ ] Versioning policy: tag releases with `vYYYY.MM.DD-<sha>` and annotate in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] CI required checks: keep `ci-all` jobs required on PRs; deploy workflow stays manual until you explicitly flip it.
- [ ] Release gates:
    - [ ] Infra tests green: `npm run test:infra`
    - [ ] Backend/unit suites green: `npm run test --workspace backend`
    - [ ] Console build succeeds with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` pinned
- [ ] Deploy to DO (manual): run `.github/workflows/deploy-do.yml` with `workflow_dispatch` after checks.
- [ ] Rollback plan: previous GHCR image tags available; rerun deploy with prior tag or `docker compose up -d` on droplet to revert.

### 2.2 Scheduled Jobs (Cron/Queues) — Accounting, Billing, Sync
Define time windows when traffic is low (FRA1 02:00–05:00 local) and prefer UTC in cron.

- [ ] Usage aggregation (daily): computes app/network usage for tiers and invoices
    - Runner: backend job/queue or cron container
    - Verify: inspect logs for completion markers; metrics exported under `/metrics` RED histograms
- [ ] Stripe sync (hourly + daily catch‑up): reconciles invoices, payments, dunning
    - Verify: `npm run verify:db --workspace backend` for DB connectivity; confirm Stripe test mode on staging
- [ ] Email queue drain (every 5 min): ensures transactional emails go out (Resend)
- [ ] Data hygiene (nightly/weekly): purge temp rows, rotate API key usage logs if needed
- [ ] Evidence hooks (optional): append summaries to `logs/cron/*.log` and surface counters in `/metrics`

Example crontab (on droplet, using rootless container exec):
```
# /etc/cron.d/apex
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

# Nightly 02:15 — usage aggregation
15 2 * * * root docker compose -f /opt/apex/infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T backend node dist/scripts/aggregateUsage.js >> /var/log/apex/cron-usage.log 2>&1

# Hourly — Stripe sync
5 * * * * root docker compose -f /opt/apex/infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T backend node dist/scripts/stripeSync.js >> /var/log/apex/cron-stripe.log 2>&1

# Every 5 min — email queue
*/5 * * * * root docker compose -f /opt/apex/infrastructure/docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T backend node dist/scripts/drainEmailQueue.js >> /var/log/apex/cron-email.log 2>&1
```

Notes:
- Prefer queue‑based scheduling inside backend where feasible; use host cron only as a thin trigger.
- Ensure Redis is healthy before queue work; see `npm run verify:redis --workspace backend`.

### 2.3 Backups & Retention (DB → Spaces + Offsite Mirror)
- [ ] Nightly logical backup of Postgres via `pg_dump` to S3‑compatible storage
    - Script template: `scripts/backup/pg_dump_s3_template.sh`
    - Configure: `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_PREFIX`, lifecycle retention (30–90 days)
- [ ] Weekly restore drill to staging DB
    - Procedure: restore latest dump to temp instance; run smoke queries; record duration (RTO)
- [ ] Evidence: store `backup-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and restore notes under `docs/Internal/Deployment/backups-YYYY-MM/`

Sample run:
```
export PGHOST=<do-pg-host> PGPORT=25060 PGDATABASE=ad_platform PGUSER=apex_admin PGPASSWORD=<admin-pass>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<spaces-key> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<spaces-secret>
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1 S3_ENDPOINT=https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com
export S3_BUCKET=s3://apex-prod-backups S3_PREFIX=pg/ BACKUP_LABEL=prod
bash scripts/backup/pg_dump_s3_template.sh
```

### 2.4 Monitoring, Metrics, and Alerting
- [ ] Enable DO Monitoring alerts: CPU/RAM>80% (5m), disk>80%, droplet unreachable
  ```bash
  doctl monitoring alert list --format ID,Type,Description,Enabled
  # Update individual alerts if thresholds need tuning
  doctl monitoring alert update <alert-id> --value 80 --enabled true
  ```
- [ ] Export Prometheus metrics from backend (`/metrics`); protect via Basic Auth or IP allowlist
- [ ] Define SLOs (initial):
    - API availability 99.9%/30d; p95 < 200ms; error rate < 0.5%
- [ ] Alert policies:
    - p95 latency > 400ms for 10m
    - error rate > 1% for 5m
    - queue length growing 15m
- [ ] Error tracking: Sentry DSN configured for backend/console; scrub PII
- [ ] Optional: Upptime for external status page on `status.apexmediation.ee`

### 2.5 Incident Response & Runbooks
- [ ] Common failures & fixes
    - Backend crashloop: `docker compose ... logs backend | tail -n 200`; check env validation; rollback image
    - Redis unavailable: confirm container health; if down, restart; investigate AOF
    - Database connection errors: confirm `?sslmode=require`; check DO PG status page; failover procedure
- [ ] Nginx 502/504: `docker compose exec nginx nginx -t && nginx -s reload`; review upstream health
- [ ] Evidence capture during incident: run `scripts/ops/do_tls_snapshot.sh` and save outputs with timestamps
- [ ] Postmortem template: cause, timeline, impact, remediation, follow‑ups

### 2.6 Security Operations
- [ ] Secrets rotation schedule (quarterly): Stripe, Resend, JWT/COOKIE secrets; update env; restart stack
- [ ] Access review (quarterly): GitHub, DO, Sentry; least privilege; remove ex‑contributors
- [ ] Patch policy: apply Ubuntu security updates weekly (unattended‑upgrades) and container base updates monthly
- [ ] TLS hygiene: certbot auto‑renew configured; HSTS locked; re‑run TLS snapshot quarterly
- [ ] Content guard: CI `policy-guard` job must remain green; forbidden providers blocked by tests

### 2.7 Capacity & Cost Management
- [ ] Observe CPU/RAM/disk trends monthly; scale droplet if p95 CPU > 70% or memory pressure sustained
- [ ] Database: monitor connections, slow queries; add indices as needed; consider plan upgrade when CPU saturates
- [ ] Storage: track Spaces/offsite usage; enforce lifecycle rules; review backup sizes
- [ ] Network egress: review DO bills; enable gzip in Nginx (already set) and cache headers where safe

### 2.8 Operator Routines (Checklist)
- Daily
    - [ ] Scan alerts and Sentry; zero criticals
    - [ ] Spot‑check `/health` and `/metrics`
- Weekly
    - [ ] Review cron logs (`/var/log/apex/*`); confirm jobs succeeded
    - [ ] Run `npm run test:infra` on main; check drift
- Monthly
    - [ ] Restore drill to staging; document RTO/RPO
    - [ ] Re‑capture TLS snapshot and verify HSTS present
    - [ ] Review costs and capacity; adjust limits
