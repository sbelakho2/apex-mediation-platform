# 🎉 System Development Status — Archived Checklist

> **Status:** Archived on 2025-11-18. This checklist previously declared every subsystem "100% complete" and is retained only for historical context.

## Original Intent
- Present a quick, checklist-style overview of console, backend, SDKs, adapters, CI/CD, and observability workstreams.
- Offer launch sequencing guidance once all boxes were checked.

## Why It Was Archived
- The claims no longer align with the active risks captured in `docs/Internal/Development/AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md`.
- FIX-10 requires a single canonical readiness narrative, so this file now defers to `docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## Current Canonical References
1. `docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md` — authoritative readiness summary.
2. `docs/Internal/Development/FIXES.md` — ordered backlog covering every open gap.
3. `docs/Internal/Development/DEVELOPMENT_TODO_CHECKLIST.md` — day-to-day tracker that now points back to FIXES.

Please record any future status updates in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and cite the relevant FIX ID plus evidence (tests, deploy logs, etc.).
