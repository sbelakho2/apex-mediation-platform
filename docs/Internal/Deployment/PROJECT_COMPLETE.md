# ApexMediation Platform – Archival Executive Summary

> **Status:** Archived on 2025-11-18. This document used to market the platform as "development complete". It is retained only for historical reference.

The authoritative delivery status now lives in `docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, which consolidates every production readiness claim with evidence from:

- `docs/Internal/Development/FIXES.md` (ordered FIX backlog)
- `docs/Internal/Development/AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md` (file-by-file risk inventory)

## Original Scope (for context only)

- Provide a high-level, marketing-oriented executive summary.
- Highlight aspirational cost/profit models for the ultra-lean stack.
- Describe automation themes (SDK releases, accounting, sales) at a narrative level.

## Why It Was Retired

- The completion claims conflicted with the open risks tracked in the FIX backlog.
- Multiple downstream docs copied this narrative verbatim, making it difficult to spot regressions.

## Where to Go Now

1. Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for the live deployment state.
2. Tie any new claims back to a FIX ID and accompanying test/deploy evidence.
3. Treat this file strictly as historical messaging; do not update it with new status language.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Database failure  
**Mitigation:** Daily backups to Backblaze B2, point-in-time recovery with Supabase, automated restore testing monthly

**Risk:** API outage  
**Mitigation:** Multi-region deployment with Fly.io, health checks every 30s, automatic failover, 99.95% uptime SLA

**Risk:** SDK crash in production  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing before release, staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%), instant rollback capability, Firebase Crashlytics monitoring

**Risk:** Breaking change breaks customer apps  
**Mitigation:** Backward compatibility testing in CI, deprecation warnings 2 versions ahead, migration guides, version pinning in package managers

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Low customer acquisition  
**Mitigation:** SEO-optimized content, GitHub Discussions for discoverability, Discord community, free tier for evaluation, transparent pricing

**Risk:** High churn rate  
**Mitigation:** Customer health scoring, automated intervention workflows, usage analytics to identify issues early, proactive support outreach

**Risk:** Competition from Unity  
**Mitigation:** Superior reliability (OTA-proof vs Unity's OTA failures), transparent bidding, faster payouts, lower take rate (10% vs Unity 30%)

### Operational Risks

**Risk:** Solo operator burnout  
**Mitigation:** Extensive automation (90%+ operations), clear boundaries (<5 hrs/week), outsource escalations at scale, potential co-founder at 1,000+ customers

**Risk:** Estonian compliance violation  
**Mitigation:** Automated e-MTA reporting, audit trail for all transactions, 7-year document retention, annual compliance review

**Risk:** Security breach  
**Mitigation:** Regular security scans, dependency updates, penetration testing, bug bounty program, incident response plan, cyber insurance
