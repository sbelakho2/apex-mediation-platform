## 🔧 Remaining Setup Steps

### Required Before Production Launch:

#### 1. Add Real API Keys
Edit `backend/.env` and replace placeholders:

```bash
# Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE

# AI automation feature flags (opt-in per environment)
ENABLE_AI_AUTOMATION=false
ENABLE_SALES_AI_OPTIMIZATION=false
ENABLE_GROWTH_AI_ANALYTICS=false
ENABLE_SELF_EVOLVING_AI=false

# Get from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys (or live keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_REAL_KEY_HERE
```

> 💰 **Cost control policy:** Leave all AI automation flags `false` in development and staging. Only enable the specific automation needed in production after validating budget impact and setting spend monitors with OpenAI usage dashboards.

**Action:** Configure OpenAI usage alerts (50%, 80%, 100%) and hard limits before toggling any AI automation flags in production.

#### 2. Test Locally
```bash
cd backend

# Start the cron jobs
npm run build
node dist/scripts/cron-jobs.js

# In another terminal, monitor logs
tail -f backend.log

# Check database for automation activity
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM evolution_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM customer_health_scores ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

#### 3. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to Fly.io staging environment
fly deploy --config fly.staging.toml

# Verify deployment
fly logs --app apexmediation-staging

# Check cron jobs are running
fly ssh console --app apexmediation-staging
ps aux | grep cron-jobs
```

#### 4. Monitor First 24-Hour Cycle
Watch these tables for automated activity:

**Hourly Monitoring (Self-Evolving):**
```sql
-- Check system health
SELECT * FROM system_health_dashboard;

-- View AI optimizations
SELECT category, description, confidence_score, auto_applied 
FROM optimization_queue 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check incidents detected
SELECT severity, category, description, status
FROM incidents
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Daily Monitoring (Growth Engine):**
```sql
-- Customer health distribution
SELECT * FROM growth_metrics_dashboard;

-- Recent churn interventions
SELECT customer_id, intervention_type, success
FROM churn_interventions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Growth opportunities identified
SELECT opportunity_type, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM growth_opportunities
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY opportunity_type;
```
