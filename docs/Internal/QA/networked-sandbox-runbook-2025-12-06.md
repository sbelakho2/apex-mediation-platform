### Networked Sandbox Runbook (2025-12-06)

This runbook executes checklist sections 0.0.7–0.0.12 on staging, captures evidence, and produces an exportable bundle.

- Test org in staging; test email inbox; Stripe test keys; Resend sandbox.
- Sandbox apps built (iOS, tvOS, Android, Android TV, Unity, Web) pointing to staging.
