# Extended requirements when GPU/PyTorch is available (optional during development)
# Pin cautiously; prefer CPU-only unless explicitly training TabPFN on hardware with GPU.
-r requirements.txt

# PyTorch (choose the appropriate CUDA wheel manually when needed, e.g. set
# TORCH_INDEX=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124 and install torch==2.5.1+cu124).
torch==2.5.1

# TabPFN (depends on torch)
tabpfn==0.1.10

# GPU gradient boosting (same version as CPU list to keep parity)
xgboost==2.0.3
