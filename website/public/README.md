# Public assets

Place public, static assets used by the Website here. Next.js serves files in this folder at the site root.

## Logo
- Add your logo image as `Logo.jpg` to be referenced by pages like About/Contact (`/Logo.jpg`).
- Optionally provide optimized variants:
  - `Logo.webp` and/or `Logo.avif` for modern browsers.
  - Keep the same dimensions/aspect ratio as the JPG for consistent layout.

Note: If you change the filename, update `website/src/app/about/page.tsx` and `website/src/app/contact/page.tsx` accordingly.
