        <h2 id="mission">Mission: Radical Transparency in Ad Mediation</h2>
        <p>
          ApexMediation is built on a simple idea: publishers deserve verifiable performance and transparent
          economics without black boxes. We engineered a mediation stack where every meaningful step—auction
          request, adapter response, decision latency, and delivery outcome—can be traced, measured, and
          independently verified.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="transparency">
        <h2 id="transparency">Transparency, Verified</h2>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Transparency</strong> feature produces a cryptographically signed trail of each auction,
          making it possible to confirm integrity end-to-end. Dashboards expose RED metrics (Rate, Errors,
          Duration) per route and adapter latency distributions (p50 / p95 / p99), with error taxonomies to
          accelerate root cause analysis. This is not a marketing claim—it is an observable system with
          invariant checks and evidence you can audit.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Signed auction artifacts and verification endpoints</li>
          <li>Adapter-level latency, timeout, and no-fill analytics</li>
          <li>Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards ready for SLOs</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="performance">
        <h2 id="performance">Performance without Compromise</h2>
        <p>
          We optimize for user experience and revenue simultaneously. SDKs are size-gated and run under
          StrictMode to prevent main-thread I/O. We enforce binary compatibility and publish API docs so you can
          upgrade with confidence. On the web, we target <abbr title="Largest Contentful Paint">LCP</abbr>
          &nbsp;&lt; 2.5s (p75) and <abbr title="Cumulative Layout Shift">CLS</abbr>&nbsp;&lt; 0.1. Budgets are baked into CI to prevent regression.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="developer-first">
        <h2 id="developer-first">Developer‑First by Design</h2>
        <p>
          Everything ships with tests, docs, and CI guardrails: Android, iOS, Unity, CTV, Console, and Backend.
          Release lanes generate artifacts automatically (AAR, XCFramework/DocC, UPM tarballs), with size and API
          surface checks. Our billing and privacy flows—usage metering, invoice PDFs, GDPR export/delete—are
          implemented with tenant scoping and audited.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="trust">
        <h2 id="trust">Trust as a Feature</h2>
        <p>
          We treat trust as a product surface: hardening security headers (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy), strict
          cookie/session policies, and redaction in logs by default. When incidents happen, operators get precise
          runbooks with synthetic probes and alert rules that reflect actual user journeys.
        </p>

      <section aria-labelledby="why-apex">
        <h2 id="why-apex">Why ApexMediation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Verifiable transparency and evidence, not claims</li>
          <li>Performance budgets that ship in CI, not slideware</li>
          <li>SDKs designed for reliability and minimal footprint</li>
          <li>Operational excellence: metrics, alerts, playbooks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you value clarity and control over your monetization, ApexMediation was built for you.
